When a combat encounter begins, you need to determine [[turn]] order for the [[round]].

All the PCs roll and the referee can either roll for the enemies or determine an appropriate DC. Whichever side has the high roll goes first. That side chooses one of their members who has not yet taken a [[turn]] this [[round]] to take their [[turn]]. If there are no members remaining, that side's [[turn]] is ignored until the end of the round. 

Once all combatants have taken a turn, that round ends and the next round begins, returning to the side who won the high roll to choose a member.

The initiative roll check is [[dexterity]] by default, but you can choose any stat you feel makes sense.
