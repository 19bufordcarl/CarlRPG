# Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class (DC) represents the number that needs to be rolled on a given [Check](Check.md) for it to be successful. 

A DC should rarely require a dice roll to lower than 8, or higher than 18.

A simple rule of thumb that works well enough is 
- 10 should be most of your checks
- 15 should be for tougher checks
- 20 should be for especially tough tasks for a character

###### Personal Note
While the referee can set any DC they want, it is important to remember they are not a computer and cannot take in all aspects of the situation. Perfect is the enemy of good enough and I find that 3 DCs serve me well for all improvised checks. I rarely stray from these 3 DCs. 

When I am preplanning important DCs, I will often not use these, to emphasize the uniqueness of that check, and try to get my desired probability.
