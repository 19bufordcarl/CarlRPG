A "turn" is simply one players turn to act. On a turn you may perform an [Action](Action.md) and [Movement](Movement.md).

Things that require very little time or effort are called a free action. These can be done at will on your turn within reason. The most common example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything, but try to keep it to a reasonable amount of time to keep the game moving and let other players have their turn.

Other examples might be picking up a piece of chalk off the ground or dropping your shield.
