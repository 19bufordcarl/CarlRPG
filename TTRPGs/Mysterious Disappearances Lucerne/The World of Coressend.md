# The World of Coressend

It is an age of uneasy peace. It has been more than 200 years since Saint Terragnis of Shtur, a human, united the kingdoms of humans and formed the Ardemn Empire. Through his infinite wisdom, Terragnis created a great golem, Annulium. With its immeasurable might, the Empire conquered all of Corressend. Time, however, devours all things. Annulium was broken into pieces and scattered. Emperor Terragnis died like all humans do. The Empire led by his descendants is more of a confederation of kingdoms and city states. Emperor Caius II has been slowly losing control over Coressend, and political struggles are brewing all over.

In the small forest farming village of Caehill, people have been going missing. The town has gone from once idyllic range to paranoid nightmare. The cause of these disappearances is a mystery, but word of their plight has reached the Meteoric Bay, and the desperate mayor is offering a hefty reward to stop whatever evil lurks in the Cloudwood.

You are 1st level characters. You have joined up with the group to take up this quest and solve the mystery, you are en route via a horse drawn cart from the outskirts of the city of Tulune.

For a reason unknown to you, a new power has awakened within you recently. Choose a 5e fantasy race. This ‘race’ represents this mysterious power and confers everything except the appearance, age, size, and language properties. You choose an ancestry for those.

Ancestry represents where your character hails from and what they look like. It will also inform how NPCs react to you. Elves and Orcs have a long history of conflicts and disdain for instance. Feel free to ask questions about lore if you are interested, no worries if not.

You are probably a human, most of Coressend is. They are as diverse as they are adaptable.

You might be an orc, most in the region live in the mountain kingdoms of Cragstone.

You might be an elf, elves typically stay secluded in the forest kingdom of Glynwyn.

You might be a tiefling, few leave the volcanic Raven Ridge mountains they call home.

You might be a dwarf, the inhabitants of the Subterrain, carving cities from caves underground.

You could be a saurian, lizardfolk that live throughout the southern jungles of Xar’lith.

You could be a hybrid, commonly half-elves and half-orcs.

# Logistics

- Character Creation
    

- Start at level 1. Point Buy or Standard Array.
    
- Your character must have a reason for being in the campaign.
    
- Moreover, I would like every PC to have at least a short backstory
    
- No setting specific abilities or homebrew please.
    

- If it’s something very minor or something you really want let me know and we can work something out.
    
- My goal with this is to make sure no PC overshadows the others. 
    

- Format
    

- I plan for this campaign to be in person as I want it to have a narrative focus.
    
- I use Foundry VTT to organize the game world and I plan to use it for the game, even in person, it is essential to how I organize notes, maps, monsters, etc.
    
- I encourage you to use it too, it has a ton of great character sheet features.
    

- Length
    

- I structure my campaigns into acts, which are about 10 sessions long usually.
    
- The campaign could go up to 3 acts long, but acts also provide points to stop.
    
- Each act ending typically corresponds with a tier of play change.
    
- Act endings can provide a narrative stopping point if desired.
    

- Themes 
    

- Power, Mystery, Trust, Treachery, Loyalty, Paranormal, Comedic, Heroic
    

- Schedule (If everyone wants to do backstories, otherwise remove those dates)
    

- Session 0: October 3rd 6:30-7:30pm on discord
    
- Basic Character Sheet & Backstory: Send to me by October 7th
    
- Prologue Session (Test Session): October 10th from 6:30 to ~9pm
    
- Final Character Sheet & Backstory: Send to me by October 17th
    
- Session 1: October 24th from 6:30 to ~9pm
    
- Game on! :) Bi-weekly from here
    

  

If this sounds good, then prepare yourselves for terror in the fog!

Backstory

If everyone is ok making a backstory that will impact the campaign narrative, this is the structure I use to ensure that everything runs smoothly.

- I need your basic backstory by October 7th
    

- This is an outline of your character backstory and character sheet
    
- Anything in the backstory is subject to change. It’s a rough draft
    

- I need your final backstory by October 17th
    

- This is a hard deadline
    
- It’s important to me that I have enough time to fully read through each players backstory in order to incorporate it into the game world
    
- If you are late you will not play in the campaign. If people do not have similar levels of commitment it will likely cause issues later. 
    

- You can make separate backstories where 2 PCs know each other
    
- There’s no hard min / max length
    

- I’ve seen great / bad ones that were just one paragraph, and great / bad ones that were a couple pages. Whatever brings you joy.
    

- Tips for Backstory Creation
    

- Add in unknowns and mysteries
    

- I do not like done backstories where a PC has limited room for growth
    

- Concepts are just as important as events
    
- Focusing a backstory on ONE thing is very difficult for both the player and GM
    
- Don’t know everything about your backstory
    

- A backstory is a foundation and not a finished house. The house is built during the campaign at the table. If there is no room left for me to use the backstory, then I will have to ask to alter parts of it.
    

- Backstory questions, try to answer as many of these as you can
    
- Mysterious Disappearances
    

- How did your character discover their newly acquired talents?
    
- Why did you decide to investigate the disappearances around Caehill? Do you have a relative from the town? Perhaps you have a suspicion on the cause? Gold?
    
- How easily does your character trust people? Why?
    
- When confronted with something beyond your comprehension, how would your character react? Why?
    
- What does your character value? What lengths would they go to protect it?
    
- What are two secrets about your character?
    

# Mechanics

Houserules

I try to minimize major house rules, and only do them to improve narrative cohesion & pacing.

1. Resurrection spells are considered the stuff of myth and legend, your character would consider them as such. There are no holy temple resurrection services or similar.
    

1. The PCs gaining access to resurrection will be part of the narrative.
    

3. Short rests only take 10 minutes.
    
4. Slow Natural Healing (Actually an optional rule in the DMG, p. 267)
    

1. “Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.”
    
2. Houserule: You get a ‘full’ rest if you drink a healing potion (any) while long resting.
    

6. Drinking a potion is a bonus action. ‘Feeding’ a potion is an action.
    

  

Leveling

I have 3 ‘flavors’ of XP I want to discuss during session 0.

1. “Standard 5e” - Killing monsters gives XP based on the CR of that monster. 
    
2. “Old-school” - Gold can be spent on ‘training’ in downtime. Each gp is worth 2 XP.
    
3. Milestone XP. At the end of each session you gain 1-5 XP. When you reach 10 XP, you level up upon completing a milestone for your character / party that you and the GM discuss, then your XP resets to 0. Milestones should start easy but get more difficult.
    

1. Session XP is determined by the following formula
    

1. Did the PCs achieve a major objective or multiple minor objectives?
    

1. No. 1 XP
    
2. Yes. 2 XP
    

3. How hard was the challenge in achieving the objective?
    

1. Medium. The party had the situation under control. 1 XP
    
2. Hard. The party had to give it their all to overcome. 2 XP
    
3. Legendary. The party either lost somebody or cheated death. 3 XP
    

Milestone XP is what I would like to do, if everyone is on board.

  
  

Miscellaneous

Generally if something is not mentioned here you can assume it is RAW. 

If you have a rule suggestion let me know and we can talk about it.

For character creation you can use the multiclass and feat optional rules.

Some popular optional rules I do not use: Flanking, Variant Encumbrance, Firearms.

If you have a question about an optional rule, ask me. I probably don’t use it but I could be convinced to use it if it's not too complicated and sounds fun.

# Game Style

Lethality

I do not ‘balance’ encounters retroactively to make them meet your power level. Characters and monsters have power levels balanced to the setting. That being said, I strive to dispense info freely about potential dangers, provided said info is knowable. If you feel something is unclear feel free to ask for clarification. You won’t have perfect info, mind you, but reasonable in-world knowledge. In my experience, this has ended up effectively balancing encounters. 

I am not the adversary, I am the referee. I strive to create a world with a wide range of interesting decisions. Some decisions can lead to deadly situations. This is important to me to make the world feel alive and create tension. Be willing to retreat or gain ‘unfair’ advantages if you feel a fight is unwinnable. “I don’t believe in a no-win scenario” – Some space guy

Alignment

‘Good’ and ‘Evil’ are more tangible in this world. Think light side / dark side from Star Wars. They are not just selfish vs. selfless, but represent opposing cosmic forces of some… ‘energy’.

Your character may or may not be actively aware of this depending on their amount of study on religion / arcana. What your character makes of the mysterious cosmic forces of ‘Good’, ‘Neutral’, or ‘Evil’ is up to you, but the fact that there are these cosmic alignments will have impacts in the game. I will assume nobody’s character is evil.

Aesthetic

Coressend is a medium fantasy world. Magic is rare, but not so rare as to have no impact on daily life. There are mages guilds and alchemists, but magic is quite expensive and out of the realm of most people, and many human commoners are distrustful of power hungry mages, known for causing the common folk great strife with their arcane wars. 

Overall this world is quite primitive. Agriculture is the primary occupation and many people are illiterate. Transportation is slow, kingdoms are small, and specialization and trade are minimal compared to our modern day.  Ancient Greece and Egypt were large inspirations.

The rest of the doc has some basic lore about the world your character would know.

Lore

Ancestries

All ancestries are typically medium, but you can choose to be small if it makes sense for your PC.

I prefer to not have racial abilities for a few reasons. 

1. ‘Racial Abilities’ has some terrible history behind it and just sounds awful.
    
2. 5e’s races impose a lot of seriously limiting assumptions about the setting.
    

  

Humans - The most common ancestry. They are as diverse as they are adaptable. The human empire is seated in Chroma on the island Imperia. The meteoric bay, home to the 3 major cities of Dusk, Tulune, and Wyrmrest is where most humans call home, and is the spot of most political struggles as the bay is crucially important to the trade routes of the human Empire. Other ancestries tend to dislike humans due to the history of the Empire. Elves tend to view themselves as superior to humans and it is a piece of shame that they lost to such inferior beings. Lizardfolk are distrusting of humans after they allowed the tieflings to enslave many of them for mining work in the Raven Ridge mountains. There are said to be forest clans of “halflings”, very short humans, but they are probably a myth…

Age: 70-90, Languages: Common, Dialect Common

  

Orcs - The mountain kingdoms of Cragstone are home to the orcs, and some of the finest warriors and blacksmiths in the Empire. Orcs remain a people divided however, as some still prefer their ancient ways of viking raids, pillaging and the horde. In their legends, they were once a tribe of elves who were deceived by other elves, who led them to be cursed with their tusks and short lives. They despise Elves accordingly. Many orcs actually hold a great deal of respect for humans as orcish culture values might and authority highly. The political elite of the Empire would contend, however, that Orcs are power hungry beasts looking to take control for themselves at the first opportunity and their respect is a mere facade.

Age: 60-80, Languages: Common, Orcish

  

Elves - Elves typically stay secluded in their forest kingdom of Glynwyn. They are famed for having wise scholars and powerful mages due to their long life spans. They are often looked at with disdain by other ancentries as they are perceived as being snobby. They have complex internal politics, and tend to live harmoniously with nature. Elves tend to value harmony and balance above all else, and many view the human Empire as an affront to said balance. Rumors speak of some elves deep in the Glynwyn Weald who are quite short (gnomes).

Age: 300-400, Languages: Common, Elvish

  

Tieflings - The volcanic Raven Ridge mountains have crafted mighty warriors through fire. Their legends say that they were once a tribe of humans, whose religious leaders learned from the great Erevanthe, a mysterious deity. From their knowledge, they were blessed with glorious horns, as well as superior strength and intellect. Other ancestries are unlikely to have ever seen a tiefling and thus will treat one they encounter likely with superstition, having heard legends about their heathen deities and religious practices. Most Saurians hate the tieflings because of their enslavement under the justification they are “lesser” creatures. Tieflings tend to value family, honor, and power. They dislike the Empire because it hinders their independent power.

Age: 80-100, Languages: Common, Infernal

  

Dwarves - The subterranean dwarves were once closely allied with Humans, they were the first other ancestry to join the Empire and their legendary craftsmanship and artificery was instrumental in their conquests. In exchange, the Empire has left the dealings of the Subterrain largely to the dwarves, but as the Empire’s strength wanes, there are rumors that dwarven politics have grown… complicated. The dwarves despise the Orcs as they have many legends of Orcs pillaging their cities. Dwarves are well enough liked by most other ancestries as their seclusion in their underground cities and mines have saved them from most of the conflict of the surface dwellers. Elves, however, distrust the greedy dwarves and their unnatural creations.

Age: 100-120, Languages: Common, Dwarvish

  

Saurians - The lizardfolk have an unfortunate plight in a world dominated by mammalian creatures. Their strange and alien appearance has led them to be treated like beasts and monsters by many. They are from the Xar’lith jungle, a place poorly documented by imperial scribes with legends of gigantic lizards larger than a house. Few non-saurians have been to Xar’lith. Many people view the lizardfolk as strange, alien and treat them with hesitation. The more learned folk might have more nuanced opinions, save for tieflings, who have stolen countless saurians from their homes as slaves. Lizardfolk have a gender fluid physiology and culture. In the pockets of Saurian civilization that remain, such as Krik’ras, they are highly egalitarian and value freedom and self determination. Saurians cannot have hybrids.

Age: 60-80, Languages: Common, Draconic. Cold-blooded.

  

Hybrid - It has become increasingly common as the Empire has increased travel between regions to have hybrid ancestries. Half-orcs (human / orc) are the most common, followed by half-elves (human / elf). Half-tieflings of any sort are quite rare, and mixes between elves and orcs are even rarer still as there is extensive bad history between them. Orcs are very accepting of half-orcs. Elves are fine with half elves. Tieflings dislike half-tieflings. Generally speaking if somebody had issues with one of your ancestors, they will probably have an issue with you.

Deities, and some more about Alignment

While many in the world of Coressend are religious, it is not in the traditional 5e fantasy sense of churches worshiping all powerful and knowable pantheons of deities. Coressend ‘deities’ are more mysterious. Most deities worship is tied to a specific region, with only a few deities, such as Shtur, having wide reaching followers. I provide a list of some notable ones that most humans from near the meteoric bay (the body of water encompassing Tulune, Dusk, and Wyrmrest) would have heard about. This is not an exhaustive list. If you have a question about a deity, or want a deity with a different domain for your character background talk to me.

‘Metagaming’ Knowledge

The world we journey in is not defined by any texts or foretold tales. The books that lay before us (PHB, Monster Manual, etc.) can be helpful in understanding this place, but should not be relied on for fact regarding history, trivia, metrics or the details of one’s foe.

  

You need not worry about metagaming by using these books at my table. All that is found within represents information that one would be likely to find in a well appointed library, and if you go to these lengths in our game your character is entitled to all the knowledge they hold. This includes the stat blocks that are listed for the species covered, which represent anecdotes detailing the appropriate metrics based on personal accounts and encounters.

  

It is worth noting that as historical estimates and mythological legends often are, the player’s handbook and other such guides are often inaccurate and certainly incomplete. What if the great Basilisk really only has four legs but the last time anyone fought one the lone survivor was a knight who suffered horrible brain damage blurring his memory of the event? Perhaps a king once commissioned monster hunters to seek out and slay the source of evil terrorizing a village. They found nothing, and made up a story of a Beholder to save their necks, a wholly fake creature. It’s possible that the cat-like form of a displacer beast was just the form that particular creature chose that day, and that was the last time one ever fought anyone who cared to write it down. While the guides we use are simple and effective for our use, they would not be that way in the context our characters would find them. Our guides instead allude to our characters’ clumsy interpretations of the histories they would really find, some history, some myth.

  

Our books contain useful information and mechanics, as well as the rules we’ll stick to for building our characters and carrying out combat. They’re not a comprehensive encyclopedia for our game and they should be referenced with care.
