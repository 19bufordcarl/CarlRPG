# Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage taken from [Slashing](../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md), [Piercing](../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md), and [Bludgeoning](../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) by the armor's damage reduction value.

If an armor is heavy, the wearer has [Disadvantage](../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), and sinks in water.
	The wearer can make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) every 6 second [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.

Armor takes 2 minutes to don / doff per [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md) it uses, except for shields, which are treated as normal items, (dropped freely and picked up with 5’ of [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md)).

If you do not meet the minimum strength requirement, you have [Disadvantage](../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), and your [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) speed is decreased by 15’.

## Shield Block
Shields require one free hand to wield. Shields grant the wielder a [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) to attempt to block an incoming attack that deals [Bludgeoning](../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md), [Piercing](../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md), or [Slashing](../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md) damage after the attack [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). To block an incoming attack, the shield bearer makes a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to the target's attack [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a successful block, the bearer reduces the damage by an additional 5. On a failure, damage proceeds as normal. (Reactions can only be used once per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)).
