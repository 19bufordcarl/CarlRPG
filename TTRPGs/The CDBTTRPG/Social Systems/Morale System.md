# Morale

Morale is the system to handle how combative NPCs react to the party. When a breaking point occurs, a PC may make a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 + (highest level creature) [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to break their morale.

The following are considered breaking points.
- A solo monster going below half HP
- A group losing half their members or their leader

On a successful morale check the enemies will go into life preservation mode. They should first try to flee, if they deem that impossible or unlikely then they may attempt surrender. Particularly sly enemies may feign surrender until the party provides a vulnerable opening.
