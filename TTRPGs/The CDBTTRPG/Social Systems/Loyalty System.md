# Loyalty Score

Allowing PCs to amass followers is an optional rule. Lots of followers alter the feel and style of game greatly, and the rest of the system functions fine without this follower and loyalty system. 

Loyalty is the system to handle how follower NPCs react to the party. A followerâ€™s **Loyalty Score** is equal to the number of seasons (3 months) they have been with the party rounded down. Groups of followers should have their loyalty tracked as a group.
## Loyalty Checks
There are many instances where a follower's loyalty should be checked to see if they stay. 
- Strife
	- Offensive actions to a follower, which also reduce their loyalty by 1.
	- If an NPCs loyalty is 4 or less and the action is extremely offensive / irredeemable, they may leave immediately. 
		- Such as not paying them on time or lying about their pay.
		- Once their loyalty is 5 or more it should be very hard to have them leave with a single act. Such acts would still lower their loyalty by at least 1.
- Opportunity
	- When the party ends a session in a civilized area with other opportunities.
	- If the follower comes across a particularly powerful artifact / offer.

To make a loyalty check, the referee asks the PC to make a [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with the [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 - the followers loyalty score. On a failure the follower leaves to explore other opportunities.
