# Ranged Attack

To make a ranged attack, you make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's ranged [Armor Class](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), generally equal to 10 + the target's [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md). On a success, you roll damage die according to whatever [Weapon](../Items/Known%20Equipment/Weapons.md) you used to make the attack, and add your [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) to get the final damage.

The range of the weapon you use represents how far you can hit a target. You incur a -2 penalty to attack [Checks](../../Game%20Structure/Check.md) (but not damage) per time you would need to add the range to reach the distance to the target.
	Ex. I have a short bow with a 120 foot range, the following penalties would apply

| Distance to Target | Penalty |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| < 120'             | 0       |
| 120'-240'          | -2      |
| 240'-360'          | -4      |
| etc.               | etc.    |

Improvised ranged attacks such as throwing a rock deals 1 + [Strength](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) damage and have range 30'.

Making a ranged attack [Check](../../Game%20Structure/Check.md) while [Threatened](../../Conditions/Threatened.md) by a melee combatant imposes [Disadvantage](../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
