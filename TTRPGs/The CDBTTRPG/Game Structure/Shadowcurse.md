# Shadowcurse

The Shadowcurse is a setting specific optional rule. 

The origins of the Shadowcurse are a mystery, it has cursed the lands of the world for many an age. Anywhere in total darkness starts to be consumed by the Shadowcurse. Moonlight and starlight keep the overworld from the curse, but in the underworld the Shadowcurse has taken hold. 

Strange and usually dangerous creatures seep in to inhabit the Shadowcursed underworld. Light sources are paramount to overworld creatures being able to survive in areas afflicted by the Shadowcurse.

The Shadowcurse does not take hold immediately, lights going out in a village basement won't cause ghouls to spring up out of the ground. But, after a long enough time in the dark, the Shadowcurse inevitably takes hold of the environment, along with all sorts of unnatural creatures.

If using the Shadowcurse, it is recommended that light tracking happens in real time, using a timer to track the torches to increase tension at the table. When [Delving](Delving.md), the players can decide to do something that will take time. The referee should adjust the light timer down 6 minutes for each round this longer action takes, and make the appropriate number of hazard die rolls.
