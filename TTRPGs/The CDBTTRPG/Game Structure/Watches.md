# Watches

A watch is four hours long. 

Most major actions (travelling, foraging, etc.) take a watch to complete.

Watches are used in overland traveling, or when resting in a dangerous place.

Hex crawls are assumed to consist of 3 types of terrain.

| Type        | Time to traverse |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Normal      | 1 watch          |
| Difficult   | 2 watches        |
| Treacherous | 3 watches        |

Given the danger level of the area, roll the [Journey Hazard Die](Overland%20Journeys.md) the appropriate number of times, choosing the lowest result among the dice rolled.

| Danger | Times to roll the Hazard Die |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| None   | 0                            |
| Normal | 1                            |
| Risky  | 2                            |
| Deadly | 3                            |
