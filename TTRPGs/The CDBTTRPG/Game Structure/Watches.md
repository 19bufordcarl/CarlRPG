# Watches

Each watch is four hours long. 

Most major actions (travelling, foraging, etc.) take a watch to complete.

Hex crawls are assumed to consist of 3 types of terrain.

| Type        | Time to traverse |

| Normal      | 1 watch          |
| Difficult   | 2 watches        |
| Treacherous | 3 watches        |
