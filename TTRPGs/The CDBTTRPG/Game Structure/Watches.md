# Watches

Each watch is four hours long. 

Most major actions (travelling, foraging, etc.) take a watch to complete.

Hex crawls are assumed to consist of 3 types of terrain.
1. Normal - Takes 1 watch to traverse the hex
2. Difficult - Takes 2 watches to traverse the hex
3. Treacherous - Takes 3 watches to traverse the hex
