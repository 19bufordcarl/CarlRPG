# Overland Journeys (Hex Crawls)

While on a journey (hex crawl), days are divided into six [Watches](Watches.md): 
	Three for day
	Three for night 

If the party is traveling along a road, it is generally better to abstract the journey into the total time it will take. If there is very little to no danger, this level of granularity provides no value. Use watches and hex crawl rules for overland travel only when traversing dangerous areas.

At the end of each watch, roll the Journey Hazard Die. If there is no danger, don't roll it.

## Journey Hazard Die

At the end of each [Watch](Watches.md), roll the Journey Hazard Die (d6).

| d6  | Result                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Encounter: The referee should have something prepared, or a table                                                                                |
| 2   | Fatigue: Each party member takes 1 damage to their [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) |
| 3   | Weather: The [Weather](../Hazards/Weather.md) or something about the environment changes                                                         |
| 4-6 | Free: No effect                                                                                                                                  |
Given the danger level of the area, roll the Journey Hazard Die the appropriate number of times, choosing the lowest result among the dice rolled.

| Danger | Times to roll the Hazard Die per Watch |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| None   | 0                                      |
| Normal | 1 (At the end)                         |
| Risky  | 2 (Halfway through and at the end)     |
| Deadly | 4 (Every hour)                         |
