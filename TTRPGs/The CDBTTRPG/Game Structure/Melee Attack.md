# Melee

To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare it to the target's melee [Armor Class](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), generally equal to the target's [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md). On a success, you deal damage according to whatever [Weapon](../Items/Known%20Equipment/Weapons.md) you used to make the attack.

Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal 1 + [Strength](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) damage unless otherwise noted.
