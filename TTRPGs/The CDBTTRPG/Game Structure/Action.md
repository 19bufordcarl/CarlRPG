# Action

An action is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md). 

Usually, anything that involves making a [Check](Check.md) is an action, unless it is part of your [Movement](Movement.md).

The standard [Combat](Combat.md) actions are
- [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md)
- [Ranged Attack](Ranged%20Attack.md)
- [Casting a Spell](../Magic/Spellcasting.md)
- Use a magic item
- Ready an action to gain it as a reaction until your next turn
- Gain extra [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal movement speed this turn
- Or Improvise!

Most [Delving](Delving.md) actions are less standard; exploration and roleplay is the gameplay. Standard actions:
	- Searching a room
	- Delve movement
