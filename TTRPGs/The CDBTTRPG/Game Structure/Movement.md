# Movement

On a turn in combat, you can move 30 feet. Shadowdark referred to as "near". On a grid each square is usually 5ft, so this would be 6 squares. In a measurement system 5ft would be 1in, so this would be 6 inches.

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:
- Crawling
- Sneaking
- Wading
- Swimming
- Difficult Terrain
- Climbing

You can use 5 feet of movement to perform minor actions. The most used examples being:
- Quaff a potion
- Stand up
- Open a door
- Lie down / Crouch
- Pull a lever
- Pick up an item

*Optional Rule:*
*PCs have a base move speed of 30 feet. Add 5 x [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) feet to this base to calculate your PCs move speed. Negative dexterity reduces move speed.*

*Good for gamers who enjoy the nitty gritty of positioning tactics on battle maps.*
