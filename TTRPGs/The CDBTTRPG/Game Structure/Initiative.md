# Initiative

When a combat encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

All the PCs make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) and the referee can either roll for each enemy or determine an appropriate average roll. Whoever rolls highest goes first. When it is the PCs turn, play passes to the left, skipping the referee until all PCs have gone. Then the referee acts for all the enemies.
	If PCs wish to wait until another PC goes, they can use the ready [Action](Action.md).

Once all combatants have taken a turn, that round ends and the next round begins, returning to the side who won the high roll.

The initiative roll check is [Dexterity](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) by default, but you can choose any stat you feel makes sense.
