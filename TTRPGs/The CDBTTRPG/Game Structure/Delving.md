# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, but not currently engaged in combat (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered delving.

While delving, time is divided into 6-minute segments called delve [Rounds](Round.md) (10 . Most major actions (moving, searching, fighting, resting, etc.) take one delve round to complete. 

According to the danger level, roll the hazard die at the end of the appropriate rounds.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die     |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Normal       | Every 3 rounds |
| Risky        | Every 2 rounds |
| Deadly       | Every round    |

| 6   | Sign: If the party was looking for something secret, they find a clue                                                                            |
## Delve Movement

- **Crawl**: The standard movement rate in a dungeon is 120 feet (24 five-foot squares) per delve [Round](Round.md). Characters moving at this speed will spend most of the time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows the party to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid being surprised. 

- **Walking**: 2,400 feet (480 five-foot squares) per round. At walking speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters and spring all traps.

- **Running**: 4,800 feet (960 five-foot squares) per round. At running speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. Candles are blown out.
## Illumination

If the party finds itself in total darkness, they cannot use their map to navigate and most actions will be at [Disadvantage](../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) or impossible. Standard light sources last 1 hour, or 10 [Rounds](Round.md).

- **Torches**: Illuminates brightly for 30 feet and dimly for another 10 feet. Uses a slot.

- **Candles**: Illuminates out 5 feet. Group of 20 per slot.

- **Lanterns**: As torches, but they cannot be blown out. Uses a slot.
## Searching

**Hidden Features**: A PC can use an [Action](Action.md) to search a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a coin pouch behind a rock, a cracked tile, etc.) In dim light like candlelight, this takes two turns. 

**Secret Features**: Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have corresponding clues but can only be found through the players describing the PCâ€™s actions.
