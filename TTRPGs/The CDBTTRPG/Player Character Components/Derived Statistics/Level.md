# Level

Your level starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach 10 [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md)

When you level up, you can increase 3 different ability scores by 1 each, or 1 ability score by 2.

When you level up you also gain a perk point according to the following chart. Players by default start with 1 perk point, but this can be omitted for a more streamlined character creation process.

Optionally you can play without perks for an especially streamlined experience.
