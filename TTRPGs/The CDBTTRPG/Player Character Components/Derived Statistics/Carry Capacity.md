# Carry Capacity

This game uses an Item Slot system. An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. A PC has 10 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [[Item Slots]]. 

An item slot is something that either 
	1. Weighs around 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

**EXCEPTION**: One day's worth of rations take up 1/2 an item slot

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are
	1. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
	2. 500 [Coins](../../Referee%20Specific/Economy/Coins.md) 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
	3. 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Magic/Mythril.md) powder 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)

If a PC wishes to carry more than their constitution allows, then they choose to drag their pack. Dragging a pack requires both of their hands. And you can get 2 additional item slots by doing so. If you are attacked while dragging your pack you will skip your first turn in combat as you have to spend it pulling out your weapons and dropping what you were carrying.

The PC's clothing (not armor) and first Backpack do not take up a slot.
