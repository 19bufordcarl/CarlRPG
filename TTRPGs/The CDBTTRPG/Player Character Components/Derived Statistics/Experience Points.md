# Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) represents the PCs progression throughout the game. 

At the end of each session, the referee may award the group somewhere between 1 to 5 XP. Each PC in the group gets the same number of XP.

How the referee awards XP is up to them (objectives achieved, coins retrieved, monsters killed) all can work well.

A good default recommendation is to try to award XP based on how successful the party was that session, however this campaign defines success. XP rewards of 3 or 4 should be how much a competent group usually gets. 5 XP is reserved for especially impactful sessions, and 1 XP reserved for the party's worst defeats.

There is an argument to be made that we learn more from our failures than our successes. While this is true, the behavior a game rewards is the behavior a game encourages, and we don't want the PCs to be trying to fail, it makes for a bad story and a bad game.
