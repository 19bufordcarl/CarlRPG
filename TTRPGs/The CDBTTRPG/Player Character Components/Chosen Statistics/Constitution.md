# Constitution

Abbreviated as **CON**

Your strength represents your physical endurance.
The guaranteed use cases for strength (you may add your stat to the roll) are as follows:

- How much you can carry (without tiring)
- How much damage you can take
- How quickly you can recover health
- Traveling long distances
- Resisting physical effects (cold, disease, poison, acid, etc.)

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **CON**
