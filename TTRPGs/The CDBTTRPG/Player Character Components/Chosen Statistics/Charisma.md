# Charisma

Abbreviated as **CHA**

Your charisma represents the strength of your connection to your fellow mortal and yourself.
The guaranteed use cases for charisma (you may add your stat to the roll) are as follows:

- Using some magical artifacts
- [Social Reactions](../../Social%20Systems/Social%20Reactions.md) and skills (persuade, deceive, intimidate, perform, impress, etc.)
- [Morale](../../Social%20Systems/Morale%20System.md) of your enemies
- [Discounts](../../Referee%20Specific/Economy/Discounts.md) when bartering for items
- [Loyalty](../../Social%20Systems/Loyalty%20System.md) of your followers and how many you can have (optional rule)

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **CHA**
