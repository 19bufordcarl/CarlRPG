##### Setting Lore
*Elves typically stay secluded in their forest kingdom of Glynwyn. They are famed for having wise scholars and powerful druids and mages due to their long life spans. They are often perceived as being snobby. They have complex internal politics, and tend to live harmoniously with nature.* 

*Elves culture tends to value harmony and balance above all else, and usually views the [Human](Humans.md) Empire as an affront to said balance.*
