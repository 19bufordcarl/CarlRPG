**Setting Lore**
*Known to the Humans as Demonkin, they refer to themselves as Izmarodi, or 'The Changed Ones'. The volcanic Raven Ridge mountains have crafted mighty warriors through fire. Their legends say that they were once a tribe of humans, whose religious leaders learned from the great [Erevanthe](../../Magic/Spells/Patrons/Erevanthe.md), a mysterious deity. From their knowledge, they were blessed with glorious horns, as well as superior strength and intellect.* 

*Other ancestries are unlikely to have ever seen an Izmarodi and might treat one they encounter with superstition, possible having heard legends about their heathen deities and religious practices. Most [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md) hate the Izmarodi because of their enslavement after the Izmarodi conquered the northern parts of the Xar'lith jungle.* 

*Izmarodi culture tends to value family, honor, and power. They dislike the Empire because it threatens their independence.*
