# Ancestry

Your ancestry does not confer any real mechanical benefits in this game by default.

If your setting does have fantasy ancestries, then the appropriate benefits would be the following

- That ancestry's lifespan, physical appearance, language, social context and culture.

You can add additional mechanics but that is not assumed. I don't like having abilities tied to your ancestry personally. I want my character's appearance to be independent of their mechanics. 

The assumed setting of this game has the following list of ancestries

- [Humans](Humans.md)
- [Elves](Elves.md)
- [Orcs](Orcs.md)
- [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
- [Demonkin](Demonkin.md)

### A Note About Racism
Race in RPGs has had many parallels from our real world's history of racism. I believe it's important to acknowledge this fact before detailing this system any further. I choose the term ancestry because it reads much nicer and detached from the terrible history that the word 'race' has, but it is undeniably related. That being said, I made the system with this in mind.

The ancestries in my setting are all united by one thing. They have a mortal soul, equal and priceless. No ancestry get bonus to certain ability scores based on their 'nature'. I don't suggest that PCs with testosterone should have bonuses to their strength. In my opinion it's just reinforcing hierarchies I don't like, and thus wouldn't feel comfortable forcing on my players. I am writing the game I would want to play and that isn't a game I want to play. If you feel differently, I suggest the book "Who's Afraid of Gender" by Judith Butler, or any other philosophical books on the structures of race and gender.

With that out of the way, I do like to have each fantasy ancestry have some unique physical trait because it magic and fun and I think it fosters more of a connection between the PC and their ancestry. In my games I run I tried running it where the only difference is social and everyone's ancestry just felt the same, unless I had NPCs treat them differently based on ancestry, which I realized was not comfortable doing. I tend to have imperialism as a major theme in my games and it almost always centers around the Human Empire. The structures of this world are undeniably racist in their nature, but I'm not about to roleplay direct personal fantasy racism for the local barkeep, that's just really weird to me. The conclusion I came to is I can have it part of my game and system, so long as it stays structural, out of the roleplaying sphere, and clearly wrong. In my experience, this allowed the PCs to engage with ideas like "why is the world this way?" and "do we want to change it?" in a natural way without awkward / triggering roleplay moments. 

If you prefer to play in an already diverse cosmopolitan setting that works too, and might be better honestly. I just really like the homebrew world I've built and the tension that the subtly evil Human Empire provides the setting is a core part of what I like about it.
