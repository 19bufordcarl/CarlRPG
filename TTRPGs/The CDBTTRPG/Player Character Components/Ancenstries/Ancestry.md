# Ancestry

Your can absolutely use this system without Ancestries. Ancestries are always, in my opinion, setting specific. This will detail the ancestries for the assumed setting of this system.

If your setting does have fantasy ancestries, then the appropriate benefits would be the following

- That ancestry's lifespan, physical appearance, language, social context and culture.
- A unique physical trait of that ancestry. Ex: Lizardfolk are amphibious.

You can add additional mechanics but that is not assumed. I don't like having abilities scores tied to ancestry personally, as it feels a bit too limiting on aesthetics.

The assumed setting of this game has the following list of ancestries

- [Humans](Humans.md)
- [Elves](Elves.md)
- [Orcs](Orcs.md)
- [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
- [Infernals](Infernals.md)

### A Note About Racism
The history of race in RPGs has had many parallels from our real world's history of racism. I believe it's important to acknowledge this fact before detailing this system any further. I choose the term ancestry because it reads much nicer and detached from the terrible history that the word 'race' has, but it is undeniably related. That being said, I made the system with this in mind.

The ancestries in my setting are all united by one thing. They each have a mortal soul, equal and priceless. I am writing the game I would want to play. I don't like tying ability scores to ancestry because the idea that some are just naturally smarter, while others are naturally stronger has some serious baggage to it that I cannot get past. There are unique abilities you can give ancestries that make gameplay fun, are more interesting, and don't reinforce this pseudo-'naturalism' of racism. Different but similar, I don't want men in RPGs to have higher strength because they tend to have more testosterone, it's just reinforcing the pseudo-'naturalism' of sexism. If you feel differently, I suggest the book "Who's Afraid of Gender" by Judith Butler, and other philosophical books on race and gender.

With that out of the way, I do like to have each fantasy ancestry have some unique physical trait founded in their magical lore. I think it fosters more of a connection between the PC and their ancestry. In my games I tried running it where the only differences were social and everyone's ancestry just felt the same, unless I had NPCs treat them differently based on ancestry, which I realized was not comfortable doing. I tend to have imperialism as a major theme in my games and it almost always centers around the Human Empire. The structures of this world are undeniably racist in their nature, but I'm not about to roleplay direct personal fantasy racism for the local barkeep, that's just really weird to me. 

Baldur's Gate 3 had a very tactful handling of this with the Tiefling refugees, the duergar and deep gnome slaves, and the general reactivity to the players race without feeling awkward, and I found that illuminating. The duergar / drow / deep gnomes have lots of conflict, but they never say 'get out of here you dang dirty drow', they discuss their enslavement by the drow, or the drow discuss their culture of power and authority over everyone, including other drow. The conclusion I came to is I can react to race as part of my game and system, so long as it follows this structural kind of reactivity, and is clearly bad. In my experience, this allowed the PCs to engage with narrative driving ideas like "why is the world this way?" and "do we want to change it?" in a natural way without awkward / triggering roleplay. 

Regardless, setting expectations around how race / ancestry is treated in the setting is an important part of session 0 to make sure everyone is respecting one another's boundaries.

As always this is just the default setting. Feel free to tinker with it to suit your taste.
