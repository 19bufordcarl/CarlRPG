# Backgrounds

Your background represent what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer. If you want your character to be younger and not have had a career, this can be what your parents / caretakers did and you'd still benefit similarly, absorbing the knowledge and helping them out.

Table taken from Shadowdark and changed slightly.

Your background knowledge and skills might prove useful during your adventures. Work with the referee to determine if your background provides you advantages in a given situation, or make a custom background.
