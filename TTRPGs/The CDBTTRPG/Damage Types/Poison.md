# Poison

Most commonly coming from the [Gaea](../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md) domain of spells, this represents the damage that nature can impose through it's lifeforce. The venom of the snake. The corrosion of the acidic tar pits. While we document it as poison, it is only because it is poison to us. [Necrotic](Necrotic.md) opposes all living things, but poison to one is lifeforce to another. The snakes venom kills the the rabbit, yet feeds the snake. The acid of the tar pit kills the mammoth, yet feeds the fungus and worms. [[Necrotic]] undoes the very forces that binds life to this realm.
