# Vitalic

Commonly coming from [Life](../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Life.md) magic, this damage type represents the sheer energy of the lifeforce of spirits that one can infuse into a living being. Usually this is channeled for healing, but against unholy agents of death it can prove the most effective weapon.
