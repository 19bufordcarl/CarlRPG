# Thunder

The damage type most unique to the [Aer](../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Air.md) domain, this represents the damage type done by the carry of energy through the air itself. While similar to the concussive force of bludgeoning damage, the distinction is that this concussive force is always carried through the medium of the air, rather than a particular energy orb or metal instrument.
