Your only [Movement](../Game%20Structure/Movement.md) option is to crawl unless you stand up and thereby end the condition.

You have [Disadvantage](../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on melee attack [Checks](../Game%20Structure/Check.md).

An attack [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md) against you has [Advantage](../Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, the attack roll has [Disadvantage](../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
