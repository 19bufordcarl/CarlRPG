# Staff of Thyrsus

### Description
*A great staff carved of an immaculate wood. Could this be a piece of the tree of life itself? It is carved with adornments almost like ivy and leaves up along the staff, and it looks like if you would only speak the right words it could flower and bear fruit. The staff feels connected to nature in a visceral way.*

This staff's spells use [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) as their spell [Casting](../../../../Magic/Casting%20Spells.md) ability.

Learning the spells requires your spirit to be at peace with nature. Whenever your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) increases you may learn 2 more spells.
