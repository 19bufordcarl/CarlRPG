# The Necronomicon

The Necronomicon is a book that is tied closely to a malevolent deity or force in the setting, couched in mystery, occult, and lost history. The book holds untold secrets and drives its readers to chaotic insanity, but the reader would call it enlightenment.

### Description
*A dusty grimoire made of a weird, soft vellum. It is not calfskin. Perhaps, lamb? Its postscript warns that it was translated from the skulls of dead gods and that its translator, the man penning these very words, would take his own life for the vile greatness of it. A splash of blood on the margins suggests it was no vain threat.*
