# A Mythril Wand

### Description
*A Thyrsus Staff is carved from wood of an ancient growth tree. It is carved with adornments almost like ivy and leaves up along the staff, and it looks like if you would only speak the right words it could flower and bear fruit. The staff feels connected to nature in a visceral way.*

## Tier 0 Abilities
###### Unlock: Upon touching the staff.
A Thyrsus lets the wielder connect to the energy of nature itself.

Choose a spell domain from among [Air](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Air.md), [Earth](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md), [Fire](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md), and [Water](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Water.md). You gain proficiency with that [Domain](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md) as well as the [Neutral](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Neutral.md) domain from meditating with this staff. This staff's spells use [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) as their spell [Casting](../../../Magic/Casting%20Spells.md) ability. The event of the PC touching the staff binds their destiny together, and the forces of nature itself grant the PC the ability to cast 2 spells with the staff. Learning the spells requires your spirit to be at peace with nature. Whenever your [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) increases you may learn 1 more spell.

You can see the elemental [spell list](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Index.md) here. You gain a +1 to all spell [Casting](../../../Magic/Casting%20Spells.md) die rolls using this staff.
