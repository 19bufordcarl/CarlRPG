# Weapons

These are mundane weapons. A martial PC is likely to end up using a special weapon for their character. These are a starting point for a character, and provide context for the baseline in this world. They can be reskinned as appropriate for the character and setting.

- #Reach means that you can melee attack a target that is 10 feet away from you 
	- Your square (5 foot gap) Target square
- #Edged means that the weapon has a sharp edge and can be used for [Slashing](../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md) and [Piercing](../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md) damage. If it is not edged it is blunt and can only be used for [Bludgeoning](../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md). 
- #Versatile means that you can optionally wield the weapon 2 handed. If you do, you can add 1 to your damage rolls with that weapon.
- #TwoHanded means that you must use 2 hands to wield the weapon.
- #Thrown means that you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack with [Strength](../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).
- #Dex means that you attack with [Disadvantage](../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) unless you have that much [Dexterity](../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).
- #Melee means you use this weapon to make a melee attack targets adjacent to you.  
- #Range is how far you can hit a target. You incur a -2 penalty to attack [Checks](../../Game%20Structure/Check.md) (but not damage) per time you would need to add the range to reach the distance to the target.
	- For 120 foot range, the following applies
		- if <120 = 0, else if <240 = -2, else if < 360 = -4, etc.
- #Loading means you must take an [Action](../../Game%20Structure/Action.md) to reload this weapon.
