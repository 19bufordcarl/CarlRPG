# Weapons

*Throwing Knives Note:*

*Yes I am aware dagger / hatchets don't have the thrown property. You can absolutely throw a them to try to hit something. That counts as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Structure/Ranged%20Attack.md) weapon. The idea that throwing a knife / axe is a valid combat technique is pure fiction. I know its a fantasy game, but this is the somewhat realistic part, not the magic part.*

*You want to throw you weapon, get a javelin.*
