# Ranged Weapons

These are mundane ranged weapons. A ranged PC is likely to end up using a special weapon for their character. These are a starting point for a character, and provide context for the baseline in this world. They can be reskinned as appropriate for the character and setting.

Attempting to use a ranged weapon while [Threatened](../../Conditions/Threatened.md) by a melee combatant imposes disadvantage
