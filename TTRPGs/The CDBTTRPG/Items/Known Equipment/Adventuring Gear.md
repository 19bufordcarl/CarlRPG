# Adventuring Gear

These items are split up by cost. All items are in portions that take up 1 [Item Slot](../../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md). Or 5 coins if they are a bit more substantial. Roll 2d4 and subtract the PCs [Charisma](../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) for small transactions.
