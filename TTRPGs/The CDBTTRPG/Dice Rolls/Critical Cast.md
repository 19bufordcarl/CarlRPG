# Critical Cast

When making an [Spellcasting](../Magic/Casting%20Spells.md) [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md), if you rolled a [Critical Success](Critical%20Success.md), you can do a critical cast.

A critical cast allows you to double any numerical effect of that spell for the duration of that spell, or double the duration itself.
