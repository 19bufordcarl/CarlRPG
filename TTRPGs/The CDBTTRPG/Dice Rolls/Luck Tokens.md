# Luck Tokens

A PC can spend a Luck Token to reroll any [Check](../../Game%20Structure/Check.md) and must use the new result.

A PC can only have 1 luck token at a time.

It is up to the referee to decide how to give out luck tokens. 

*Author's Note:*
*Generally the design of this system assumes how I run my games. I generally let players start with one luck token at the start of each session. And I only do this starting a few sessions in, after the players have done something worthy of gaining this power. After this, I only give them additional luck tokens on especially daring acts, maybe once every 3 or 4 sessions.*

*I like how this makes it feel like a predictable resource they can plan around somewhat rather than trying to do things they think might get luck tokens, but genuinely excited that they got one.*

*I also think Shadowdark underestimates just how powerful reroll mechanics are. Experienced players are very savvy with which rolls matter most and they get a lot of bang for their buck out of just one reroll. I have never had a TPK, and only one player death in sessions where I used luck tokens.*
