# Ancestry

Your can absolutely use this system without Ancestries. Ancestries are always, in my opinion, setting specific. This will detail the ancestries for the default setting of this system.



The assumed setting of this game has the following list of ancestries

- [Humans](Humans.md)
- [Elves](Elves.md)
- [Orcs](Orcs.md)
- [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
- [Infernals](Infernals.md)

## Design your own ancestries
If your setting has other fantasy ancestries, then the appropriate details you need are:

- That ancestry's lifespan, physical appearance, language, social context and culture.
- A unique physical trait of that ancestry. Ex: Lizardfolk are amphibious.

You can add additional mechanics but that is not assumed. I recommend against tying ability scores or other traits that any PC could increase as they level up to being an ancestral benefit (i.e. you start with a bonus to X). It’s preferred to have the trait being something entirely unique to that ancestry’s physical / spiritual characteristics.




### A Note About Racism
The history of race in RPGs has had many parallels from our real world's history of racism. I believe it's important to acknowledge this fact before detailing this system any further. I choose the term ancestry because it reads much nicer and detached from the terrible history that the word 'race' has, but it is undeniably related. That being said, I made the system with this in mind.

The ancestries in my setting are all united by one thing. They each have a mortal soul, equal and priceless. I am writing the game I would want to play. I don't like tying ability scores to ancestry because the idea that some are just naturally smarter, while others are naturally stronger has some serious baggage to it that I cannot get past. There are unique abilities you can give ancestries that make gameplay fun, are more interesting, and don't reinforce this pseudo-'naturalism' of racism. Different but similar, I don't want men in RPGs to have higher strength "because they tend to have more testosterone", it's just reinforcing the pseudo-'naturalism' of sexism. If you feel differently, I suggest the book "Who's Afraid of Gender" by Judith Butler, or read some other philosophical books on race and gender.

With that out of the way, I do like to have each fantasy ancestry have some unique physical trait founded in their magical lore. I think Baldur's Gate 3 had a very tactful handling of this. They had many case, Tiefling refugees, the duergar and deep gnome slaves, and the general reactivity to the players race without feeling awkward, and I found that illuminating. The duergar / drow / deep gnomes have lots of conflict, but they never say 'get out of here you dang dirty drow', there is suspicion, the gnomes discuss their enslavement by the drow, and the drow discuss their 'right' to authority. The most directly "racist" characters are the Githyanki, and the acting is played so campy and over the top most of the time it's hard to take it too seriously.

The conclusion I came to is you can react to ancestry / race as part of a system, so long as it follows this structural kind of reactivity, and is clearly bad. In my experience, this has had the PCs engage with narrative driving ideas like "why is the world this way?" and "do we want to change it?" in a natural way without awkward / triggering roleplay. 

Regardless, setting expectations around how race / ancestry is treated in the setting is an important part of session 0 to make sure everyone is respecting one another's boundaries.

As always this is just the default setting. Feel free to tinker with it to suit your taste.
