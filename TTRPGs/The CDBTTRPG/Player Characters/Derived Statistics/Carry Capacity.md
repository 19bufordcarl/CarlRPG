# Carry Capacity

This game uses an Item Slot system. An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. A PC has 10 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [[Item Slots]]. 

An item slot is something that 
	1. Weighs about 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are
	1. 2 days of rations
	2. 10 of certain [Gear](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Standard%20Gear.md) (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
	3. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
	4. 500 [Coins](../../Referee%20Specific/Economy/Coins.md) 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
	5. 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Magic/Mythril.md) powder 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)

If a PC wishes to carry more than their constitution allows, then they can get a cart, wagon, horse, or similar item.

The PC's clothing (not armor) and first Backpack do not take up a slot.
