Touching your index fingers and thumbs together, you speak the incantation and unleash flames affecting all creatures in a 15 feet long line in front of you.

Affected creatures take 2d4 [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage and flammable objects and materials are set on fire.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per spell level.*
