Touching your index fingers and thumbs together, you speak the incantation and unleash a cone of flames affecting all creatures in front of you within 15 feet.

Affected creatures take 2d6 [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage and flammable objects and materials are set on fire.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per spell level.*
