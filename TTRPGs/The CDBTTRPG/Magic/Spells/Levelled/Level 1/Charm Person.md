Your eyes glow as your incantation seeps into the targets mind, enchanting one humanoid of a level equal to or less than your INT bonus within range.

They are compelled to see you as a close friend for the duration of the spell. If the target already harbors friendly feelings toward you, they remain relatively unchanged, but will not remember you have charmed them. 

Should you or your allies engage in actions perceived as harmful by the target, the spell will abruptly end. 

Once the spell ends, the target becomes aware of the magical enchantment you placed upon them, and will very likely become hostile.
