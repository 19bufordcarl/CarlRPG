If you would take damage from a magic domain of [Air](../../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md), [Earth](../../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md), [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md), or [Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md), you can cast this spell to be [Resistant](../../../../Conditions/Resistant.md) to a [Damage Type](../../../../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) of that spell. 

Your next melee attack does an additional 1d6 damage of the damage type absorbed.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage per spell level.*
