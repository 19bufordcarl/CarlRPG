After the referee declares the result of the attack [Check](../../../../Game%20Structure/Check.md) against you, you can cast this spell. Your [Armor Class](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) becomes equal to the result of your [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Structure/Check.md), potentially causing the attack to miss.

This shield absorbs [Magic Missiles](Magic%20Missile.md).

*Upcast: No effect.*
