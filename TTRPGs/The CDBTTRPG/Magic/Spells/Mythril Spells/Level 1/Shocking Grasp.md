You touch a creature with lightning crackling between your fingers and imbue it with a strong shock. The creature takes 2d4 [Lightning](../../../../Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and it cannot take [Reactions](../../../../Game%20Structure/Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Structure/Turn.md).

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
