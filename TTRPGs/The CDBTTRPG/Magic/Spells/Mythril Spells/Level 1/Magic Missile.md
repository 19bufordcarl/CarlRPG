You make this [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Structure/Check.md) with [Advantage](../../../../Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md).

You shoot a magical bolt of energy at a target that deals 1d6 + 1 [Bludgeoning](../../../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) or [Piercing](../../../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md) damage. The missiles bend around corners if necessary, they always hit.

*Upcast: You can shoot one additional missile per spell level.*
