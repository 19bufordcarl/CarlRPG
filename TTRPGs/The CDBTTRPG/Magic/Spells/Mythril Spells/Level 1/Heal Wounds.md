You perform a basic healing ritual increases the flow of life in a creature. The creature heals 2d4 + your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Health Points](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md). Any additional healing then applies to the creature's [Fatigue Points](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md). 

This spell can only heal mortal creatures. This spell cannot heal [Scars](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).

*Upcast: You heal an additional 1d4 HP per spell level.*
