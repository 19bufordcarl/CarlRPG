You breathe out and create a toxic cloud affecting all creatures within 5 feet of you. 

Affected creatures take 1d4 [Poison](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage and must make a [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Structure/DC.md) of your [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Structure/Check.md). On a failure, the poison takes root, the creature is [Incapacitated](../../../../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) on its next turn, which it spends coughing. After that the poison wears off.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
