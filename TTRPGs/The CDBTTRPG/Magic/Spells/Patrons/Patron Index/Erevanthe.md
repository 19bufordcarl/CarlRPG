# Erevanthe

Queen of shadows, secrets, and the power in between spaces, in between the truth and lies, and in between good and evil. The ashen [Infernals](../../../../Player%20Character%20Components/Ancenstries/Infernals.md) claim her as the founder of their culture and the one responsible for their 'blessed' forms. 

Erevanthe expects strict devotion from her followers, obedience is valued above all, shadows and secrets hold the keys to power, she knows all, and you need to know not.
