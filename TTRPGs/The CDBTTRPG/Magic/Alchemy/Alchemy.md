# Alchemy

Alchemy was the foundation of magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.
## Procedure
Potion brewing requires 
1. A sterile container, usually a glass bottle
2. The Mythril required to cast that spell
3. Purified water (usually through an alchemical apparatus to achieve purification) 
4. Additional components related to the relevant spell you are trying to capture in the potion.
	1. Monster parts can aid in this significantly, or in some cases have been known to augment the potion's effects. Roll on the [[Alchemy Table]] for potential effects. DM discretion advised.
5. Make a spellcasting check for that spell, aided by the additional components you used. 
	1. Generally, spells have 3 components. Each component reduces the [DC](../../Game%20Structure/DC.md) by 5. 
	2. On a success, you have brewed a potion! This whole brewing process generally takes 1 hour. It can be done as part of resting / watch.
6. Potions retain the ranges of their spells as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
		1. Self: Liquid must be drunk
		2. Target: The liquid must touch the target / be drunk
		3. AOE: Explodes in the radius when the bottle is uncorked / broken

As a general rule of thumb at least 95% of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect. Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect. Potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the radius incurs the full effect.
