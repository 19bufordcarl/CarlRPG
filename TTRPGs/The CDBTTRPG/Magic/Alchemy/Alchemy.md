# Alchemy

Alchemy was the foundation of magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.
## Procedure
Potion brewing requires 
1. A sterile container, usually a glass bottle
2. Twice the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast that spell
3. Purified water (usually through an alchemical apparatus to achieve purification) 
4. Additional materials related to the relevant spell you are trying to capture in the potion.
	1. Monster parts can aid in this significantly, or in some cases have been known to augment the potion's effects. Roll on the [[Alchemy Table]] for potential effects. DM discretion advised.
5. Make a [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) check for that spell, aided by the additional materials you used. 
	1. Generally, spells have 3 materials. Each material used reduces the [DC](../../Game%20Structure/DC.md) by 5. 
6. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion! 
	1. The brewing process generally takes 1 hour succeed or fail. 
	2. It can be done as part of resting / watch.
7. Potions retain the ranges of their spells as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
		1. Self: Liquid must be drunk
		2. Touch/Target: The liquid must touch the target or be drunk
		3. AOE: Explodes in the radius when the bottle is uncorked / broken

As a general rule of thumb effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect. Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect. Potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the radius incurs the full effect.
