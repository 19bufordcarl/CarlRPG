# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells, the knowledge is fickle, complex and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and casting spells can be a source of fatigue.

A PC can memorize spells equal to 2 times the PCs Intelligence stat.

A PC can scribe spells in a spell book if they choose and can choose to replace any spell they know with any spell they have the appropriate knowledge of. In this way a spell book can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to memorize.

| Intelligence | Max number of spells known |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1            | 2                          |
| 2            | 4                          |
| 3            | 6                          |
| 4            | 8                          |
| 5            | 10                         |
| 6            | 12                         |
| 7            | 14                         |
| 8            | 16                         |
| 9            | 18                         |
| 10           | 20                         |

Spells that are granted by a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) do not count against your spell memorization total. 

###### Note
PCs do not automatically learn spells at level up, they must discover the spells in world.

PCs can choose to start with spells equal to their [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) at [Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/Walkthrough.md) by foregoing

The DM can choose to have access to spell books in a mages guild or equivalent to alleviate the burden of spell discovery if it is not desired for the campaign.
	In this variant, PCs can learn spells whenever they have extended rest in a safe civilized place.
