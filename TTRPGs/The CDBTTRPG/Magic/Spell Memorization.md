# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells, the knowledge is fickle, complex and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and is a source of fatigue.

| Intelligence | Max number of spells known |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1            | 3                          |
| 2            | 4                          |
| 3            | 6                          |
| 4            | 8                          |
| 5            | 10                         |
| 6            | 12                         |
| 7            | 14                         |
| 8            | 16                         |
| 9            | 18                         |
| 10           | 20                         |
Or 2 times the Intelligence stat, except at level 1 you can have up to 3 spells known instead of 2.

Spells that are granted by a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) do not count against your spell memorization total. 

###### Note
PCs are not assumed automatically learn spells at level up, they must discover the spells in world. Upon character creation the DM can decide how many spells is appropriate for the PC to know given the campaign setting. The DM can choose to have access to spell books in public libraries or equivalent to alleviate the burden of spell discovery is this is not desired for the campaign.
