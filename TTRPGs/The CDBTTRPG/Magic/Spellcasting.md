# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic on their own. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder, [Patrons](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md), or magic items.

In order to cast a [Spell](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Spell%20Index.md), you must make the appropriate ability [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). The nature of your spell casting is determined by how you cast it. 
- Casting spells via the arcane uses [[Mythril]] powder and uses [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md). 
- Casting from a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) requires the [Ability Score](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) associated with that [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md). 
- Casting from magic items pertains to the rules of that magic item. 
	- Scrolls and wands are generally treated the same as [Mythril](Mythril.md) casting. 

To successfully cast the spell, you must meet the [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) for that spell.
	Spell DCs are equal to 10 + that [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md). 

On a failed check, the spell fizzles, any Mythril powder or other resource is still consumed.

On a critically failed check, a [Critical Miscast](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.

If you fail the spell casting, you may choose to succeed it instead, you lose [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to the difference between the result of your roll and the spell's DC. If this reduces your FP to 0, you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

Spellcasting requires ***two free hands*** for complex hand movements and an otherworldly incantation to be chanted that is quite audible unless otherwise noted. Spell casting takes time, either an [Action](../Game%20Structure/Action.md), [Reaction](../Game%20Structure/Reaction.md), or some other specified amount time.

Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md).
