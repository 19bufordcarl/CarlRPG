# Casting Spells

Mortals cannot use magic on their own. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though artifacts, referred to a spell items. 

That being said, some [Artifacts](../Items/Artifacts/What%20and%20Why%20are%20Artifacts.md) can allow the bearer to cast spells. Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md).

In order to cast a [Spell](Spells/Spell%20Index.md), you must make the appropriate ability [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). The nature of your spell casting is determined by your [spell focus](../Items/Artifacts/Artifact%20Index.md). The more arcane ones require [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), the more divine / patron based ones require [Wisdom](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) or [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) depending on their nature. To successfully cast the spell, you must meet the [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) for that spell. More powerful spells have higher [DCs](../Game%20Structure/DC.md), usually equal to 10 + that [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md). 

If you fail the spell casting, you may choose to succeed it instead, you take [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) damage equal to the difference between the result of your roll and the spell's DC. If this reduces your FP to 0, you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
