# Casting Spells

Mortals cannot use magic on their own. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder, or from the [Artifact](../Items/Artifacts/Artifact%20Index.md) of a patron.

Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md).

In order to cast a [Spell](Spells/Levelled/Spell%20Index.md), you must make the appropriate ability [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). The nature of your spell casting is determined by how you cast it. 
- Casting spells via the arcane uses [[Mythril]] powder and uses [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md). 
- Casting from a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) requires the [Ability Score](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) associated with that [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md). 

To successfully cast the spell, you must meet the [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) for that spell. Spell DCs are unless otherwise noted equal to 10 + that [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md). 

Spells casting requires complex hand movements and an otherworldly incantation to be chanted that is quite audible unless otherwise noted.

If you fail the spell casting, you may choose to succeed it instead, you take [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) damage equal to the difference between the result of your roll and the spell's DC. If this reduces your FP to 0, you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
