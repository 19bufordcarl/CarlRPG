# Mythril

Mythril is the single most important resource in the world. It is only through Mythril that magic can be channeled into the world, and almost all spell casting consumes Mythril powder. 

The fickle deities have been known to grant their most devout followers certain spell like abilities, but such magic is much less well studied, confined to the realms of the mystical and religious.

Unless noted otherwise, a spell consumes Mythril powder according to the follow table to cast.

| Spell Level | Amount of Mythril Powder (coins) |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1           | 10                               |
| 2           | 25                               |
| 3           | 100                              |
| 4           | 250                              |
| 5           | 1000                             |
Mages are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. 500 coins worth of Mythril powder can fit into a pouch that takes up one [Item Slot](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).
