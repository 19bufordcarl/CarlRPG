Arcane: Mundane

Spells from the neutral [domain](!Domain%20Index.md) draw their energy from the world itself and the energy surrounding the caster. They are often less specialized and powerful, but some might find them more versatile. Some scholar's findings suggest that there is more power locked in the worldly realm than first meets the eye.
