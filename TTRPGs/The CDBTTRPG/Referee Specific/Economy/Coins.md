# Coins

Roughly speaking, a coin in this game is worth 1 coin in Knave, or 1sp in Shadowdark.

However you want to represent coins is up to you. I typically do only 1 denomination of coin for simplicity, and use gemstones for consolidation. 

In civilization, letters of credit from the authorities (bank or similar) are also space efficient if the players are on the good side of the ruling class of their civilization.
