# Discounts

Economy can vary greatly setting to setting, and so while I recommend giving discounts for high charisma characters of some amounts, the particular amount will need to be tweaked if you have made significant alterations to the default economy this system provides.

*Author's Note: All my merchants are secretly Rick Harrison. "I don't know if this is gonna sell tomorrow or in 3 months. Worth 100? Best I can do it 20 bucks". If the players want to set up a shop of their own you can meddle with this a bit, but as long as they are just adventurers, the average merchant is trying to make profit and menial bartering is not the focus of the game. For particularly important things, like magical items, finding the right buyer can yield much more wealth, but that can be a quest in itself. This are for mundane purchases.*
