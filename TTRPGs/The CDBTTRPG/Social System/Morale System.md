# Morale

Morale is the system to handle how combative NPCs react to the party. When a combat reaches a breaking point, a PC may ask for a morale check. If the referee agrees this is a breaking point, the PC may make a [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). The first breaking point in a combat's [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) is 15 + the highest level combative NPC. The second breaking point in a combat's [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) is 10 + the highest level combative NPC. The PCs can make at most 2 morale checks per combat.

The following should almost always be considered breaking points.
- A solo monster going below half HP
- A group losing half their allies or their leader
- An ambush that significantly injures the group / solo
- A spell cast of a level greater than the highest level combative NPC

Or anything else the referee deems a reasonable breaking point.
