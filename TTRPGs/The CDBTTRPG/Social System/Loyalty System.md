# Loyalty

Loyalty is the system to handle how follower NPCs react to the party. Followers start with a loyalty score equal to 10 + the PCs [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md). After each session the follower has been with the party, the PC may make a [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md) against a [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) is equal to their current loyalty. 
- [Critical Failure](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md) decreases loyalty score by 2
- Failure decreases loyalty score by 1
- Success increases loyalty score by 1
- [Critical Success](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md) increases loyalty score by 2

The higher a followers loyalty the more they will put up with the party, and vice versa. 
- Particularly offensive actions to the followers nature reduce their loyalty by 1. 
- If their loyalty is less than 15 and the action is extremely against the followers nature the referee can have them leave the party immediately. 
- Once their loyalty is 15 or more it should be nearly impossible to have them leave with a single act.
