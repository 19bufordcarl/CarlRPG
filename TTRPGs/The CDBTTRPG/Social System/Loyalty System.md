# Loyalty

Loyalty is the system to handle how follower NPCs react to the party. Followers start with a loyalty score equal to 10 + the PCs [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md). After each session the follower has been with the party, the PC may make a [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md) against a [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) is equal to their current loyalty. 
- [Critical Failure](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md) decreases loyalty score by 2
- Failure decreases loyalty score by 1
- Success increases loyalty score by 1
- [Critical Success](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md) increases loyalty score by 2

The higher a followers loyalty the more they will put up with the party, and vice versa.

There are many instances where follower's loyalty can should be checked to see if they stay. To make a loyalty check, the referee can ask the PC to make a [Charisma](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). If they roll under the followers loyalty, the follower leaves to explore other opportunities.
- Strife
	- Particularly offensive actions to the followers nature reduce their loyalty by 1. 
	- If an NPCs loyalty is less than 15 and the action is extremely against their nature, the referee can ask for a loyalty check, or leave immediately if it's irredeemable. 
	- Once their loyalty is 15 or more it should be nearly impossible to have them leave with a single act, but acts can still lower their loyalty.
- Opportunity
	- When the party ends an adventure in a civilized area, 
	- If the party comes across a particularly powerful artifact / offer
