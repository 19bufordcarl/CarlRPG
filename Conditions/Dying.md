# Dying

When you start dying, you roll a d4 and add your [Level](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). At the start of each of your turns after you roll a d20. On a natural 20 you regain consciousness with 1 [Health Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md). Otherwise, decrease that counter by 1. When this counter reaches 0 you die. Said differently, you die after that many [Rounds.](../Game%20Structure/Round.md)

While you are dying you are [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).

While you are dying an ally can spend an action to stabilize you with a DC 15 [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md).

When you are brought back to consciousness from dying, you gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
