When you start dying, you roll a d4 and add your [[Level]]. At the start of each of your turns after you roll a d20. On a natural 20 you regain consciousness with 1 [[Health Points]]. Otherwise, decrease that counter by 1. When this counter reaches 0 you die. Said differently, you die after that many [[round]]s.

While you are dying you are [[unconscious]].

While you are dying an ally can spend an action to stabilize you with a DC 15 [[Intelligence]] [[check]].

When you are brought back to consciousness from dying, you gain the [[exhausted]] condition.
