# Myth and Shadow

## Setup

Go to <https://mythandshadowrpg.com/> for the full online wiki!

If you are here, then that means you want to download a personal copy of the ruleset to access via Obsidian at your leisure for character building and gameplay.

To do so follow these steps.

1. Go to the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) website and download obsidian.
2. Hit the "<> code" button and select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract that zip file to you documents folder.
4. Open the folder that *contains* the "Myth & Shadow" folder as your vault in obsidian.
    1. Alternatively you can simply copy the Myth & Shadow folder into an existing vault.
5. Under Options > Appearance > Interface
    1. Disable "Inline Title"
    2. Files have their own names because it is more markdown standard, the inline title option will make it look like the title is there twice.

Happy Gaming!
