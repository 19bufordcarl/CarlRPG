# Myth and Shadow

## Setup
If you are here, then that means you want to download a personal copy of the ruleset, probably so you can access it via Obsidian at your leisure for character building and / or gameplay.

To do so follow these steps.
1. Go to the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) website and download obsidian.
2. Hit the "<> code" button and select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract that zip file to you documents folder.
4. Open the folder that *contains* the "Myth & Shadow" folder as your vault in obsidian.
	1. Alternatively you can simply copy the Myth & Shadow folder into an existing vault.
5. Under Options > Appearance > Interface 
	1. Disable "Inline Title"
	2. Files have their own names because it is more markdown standard, the inline title option will make it look like the title is there twice.

Happy Gaming!
