# Intro

General Notes
- Just building out a front end prototype
- Xfund (Relatively small $100 mil fund)
- PairVC (Got past the first)
- Eric and one other guy so far
	- Other guy is big PhD guy
	- Theoretically possible

Problem Summary
- NLP in foundational models
	- In context learning
		- OpenAI did just crazy scaling for attention stuff
- Based off a paper that was already getting the idea
- Companies are going to want to build an LLM to meet their own needs
- You want secure data
- Through Microsoft LLM, there's a lot of specific training that goes on to build your model
- *Leaves out small to medium sized businesses to build these models*
	- That's where we come in
- Copilot business throws out all your training data to guarantee security
- B2B

Solution
- [In Context Learning](In-context%20learning.md)
	1. Compiler automatically takes in an initial prompt
	2. Takes in-context prompt to turn it into a better prompt
	3. Pipelines can be trained independent of the LLM
- This means that none of the training data is exposed externally
