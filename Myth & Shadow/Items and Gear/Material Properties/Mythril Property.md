# Mythril Materials

Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can be used for [Crafting Magic Items](../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md).

## Mythril Weapons

Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md) must be constructed from scratch. Compared to a mundane weapon:

- The [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) is replaced with the [Mythril Property](Mythril%20Property.md).
- Mythril weapons cost much more — see [Mythril Weapon Prices](Mythril%20Property.md#Mythril%20Weapon%20Prices).
- Mythril weapons deal [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) instead of [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
	- [Ranged Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) deal the [Damage Type](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) of their [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), not the weapon.
- Mythril weapons add +1 to both attack and damage rolls.
	- Mythril [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) only changes the [Damage Type](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) dealt.
- Mythril weapons take up 1 less [Equipment Slot](../Equipment%20Slot.md) — minimum of 1.

## Lore

*Mythril metal is of the highest quality, light as cloth and tough as dragon hide. It can hold the strongest magical enchantments.*

*It is worth ten times its weight in gold; a suit of Mythril armor is worth more than small kingdoms.*
