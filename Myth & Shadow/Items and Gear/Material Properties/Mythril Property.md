# Mythril Materials

Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can be used for [Crafting Magic Items](../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md).

## Mythril Weapons

Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md) must be constructed from scratch and use any weapon with the [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) as a starting point.

- Mythril weapons add +1 to both attack and damage rolls.
	- For ranged weapons, this *does* stack with improved [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md).
- Mythril weapons deal [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) instead of [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
	- The [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) is replaced with the [Mythril Property](Mythril%20Property.md).
	- [Ranged Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) deal the [Damage Type](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) of their [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), not the weapon.
- Mythril weapons only take up 1 [Item Slot](../Item%20Slot.md).
- Some creatures cannot be harmed by [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) or [Silver Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Silver%20Damage.md).
