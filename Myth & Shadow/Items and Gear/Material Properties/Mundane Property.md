# Mundane Materials

Mundane is the default material for [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md), and other [Items](../Items.md).

These items deal [Tier 1](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) or [Edged](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Edged.md) damage.

They are usually some combination of steel, dense cloth or leather, and wood as the components for the item. For short, this is simply referred to as mundane.

Some creatures cannot be harmed by [Tier 1](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) physical damage.
