# Mundane Materials

Mundane is the default material for [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md), and other [Items](../Items.md).

It assumes some combination of steel, dense cloth or leather, and wood as the components for the weapon. For short, this is simply referred to as mundane. These items deal [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).

Some creatures cannot be harmed by [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
