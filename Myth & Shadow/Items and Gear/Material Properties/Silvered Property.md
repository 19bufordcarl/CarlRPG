# Silvered Materials

Silvered [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can be used for [Crafting Magic Items](../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md).

## Silvered Weapons

Silvering can be done to any [Weapon](../Weapons/Weapons.md) with the [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md).

- The [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) is replaced with the [Silvered Property](Silvered%20Property.md).
- Silvering a weapon costs 10x the mundane price.
- Silvered weapons deal [Tier 2](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Blunt](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) or [Edged](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Edged.md) damage.
	- [Ranged Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) deal the [Damage Type](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) of their [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), not the weapon.

### Silvered Weapon Prices

Mundane weapons can be silvered by a sufficiently talented weaponsmith. Providing the base weapon grants no discount to the price of the silvered weapon.

| Original Weapon Price | Silvered Price |
| --------------------: | -------------: |
|                    10 |            100 |
|                    25 |            250 |
|                    50 |            500 |
|                   100 |          1,000 |
|                   250 |          2,500 |

## Lore

***Scribe's Note***
*'Silvering' uses a bit of silver and Mythril alloyed with steel, making the metal lighter, without sacrificing strength. It also becomes capable of holding enchantments.*

*It was supposedly discovered by ancient Elven smiths. Accordingly, weapons and armor of this style in Mithrinia are often referred to as Elven.*
