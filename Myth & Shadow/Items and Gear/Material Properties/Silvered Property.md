# Silvered Materials

Silvered [Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can be used for [Crafting Magic Items](../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md).

## Silvered Weapons

Silvering can done to any [Weapon](../Weapons/Weapons.md) with the [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md).

- The [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) is replaced with the [Silvered Property](Silvered%20Property.md).
- Silvering a weapon costs 10x the mundane price.
- Silvered weapons deal [Silver Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Silver%20Damage.md) instead of [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
	- [Ranged Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) deal the [Damage Type](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) of their [Ammo](../Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), not the weapon.
- Silvered weapons take up 1 less [Equipment Slot](../Equipment%20Slot.md) â€” minimum of 1.

### Silvered Weapon Prices

Mundane weapons can be silvered by a sufficiently talented weaponsmith. Providing the base weapon grants no discount to the price of the silvered weapon.

## Lore

***Scribe's Note***
*'Silvering' uses a bit of silver and Mythril alloyed with steel, making the metal lighter, without sacrificing strength. It also becomes capable of holding enchantments.*

*It was supposedly discovered by ancient Elven smiths. Accordingly, weapons and armor of this style in Mithrinia are often referred to as Elven.*
