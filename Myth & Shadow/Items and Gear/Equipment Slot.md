# Equipment Slot

An *Equipment Slot* is the unit of abstraction for how much [Equipment](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Equipment.md) a PC can have.

[Items](Items.md) take up equipment slots (aka *Slots* or *Slot*).

Smaller [Items](Items.md) of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. Common examples are:

- 10 [Iron Pitons](Gear/10%20Coins/Iron%20Piton.md)
- 20 pieces of ammunition
	- [Arrow](Weapons/Ammo/Arrow.md)
	- [Bolt](Weapons/Ammo/Bolt.md)
	- [Sling Stone](Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md)
