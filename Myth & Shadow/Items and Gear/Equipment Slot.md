# Equipment Slot

An equipment slot is the unit of management for how many [Items](Items.md) a PC can have [Equipped](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Equipment.md) at once.

An equipment slot weighs about 5 pounds or is about as big as a bike helmet.

Smaller [Items](Items.md) of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. Common examples are:

- 10 [Iron Pitons](Gear/10%20Coins/Iron%20Piton.md) or [Candles](Gear/10%20Coins/Candle.md)
- 20 pieces of ammunition ([Arrow](Weapons/Ammo/Arrow.md), [Bolt](Weapons/Ammo/Bolt.md), [Sling Stone](Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md))
