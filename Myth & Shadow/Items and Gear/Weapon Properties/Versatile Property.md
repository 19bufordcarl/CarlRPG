# Versatile

A *Versatile* weapon can be wielded with one or two hands â€” see [Two Handed Property](Two%20Handed%20Property.md).

If wielded with two hands, its [Melee Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) use [Exploding Dice](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Exploding%20Dice.md) for damage rolls.
