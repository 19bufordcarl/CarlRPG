# Ammo

An *Ammo* weapon needs a type of ammunition in order to make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).

Each [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) consumes 1 piece of ammunition.

You can pick up one piece of used ammunition [Engaged](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you as part of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).

When you [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover), you pick up all salvageable ammo nearby.

*The common ammo types are [Arrows](../Weapons/Ammo/Arrow.md), [Bolts](../Weapons/Ammo/Bolt.md), and [Sling Stones](../Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md).*
