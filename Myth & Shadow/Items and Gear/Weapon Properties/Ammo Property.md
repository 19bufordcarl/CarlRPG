# Ammo

An *Ammo* weapon needs a type of ammunition in order to make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md). Each attack consumes a piece of ammunition. Typically the ammo is not destroyed and is recoverable after [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md).

*You can pick up one piece of used ammunition with an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md). The most common ammo are [Arrows](../Weapons/Ammo/Arrow.md), [Bolts](../Weapons/Ammo/Bolt.md), and [Sling Stones](../Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md). The [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) action lets you pick up all salvageable ammo nearby.*
