# Ammo

An *Ammo* weapon requires that you have the appropriate ammunition in your [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md).

The main ammo types are:

1. [Arrows](../Weapons/Ammo/Arrow.md)
2. [Bolts](../Weapons/Ammo/Bolt.md)
3. [Sling Stones](../Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md)

*Note: PCs do not need to track how much ammo they have. These old-fashioned types of ammo are often recyclable, and so it is very unlikely that the PCs would run out of ammo. Some special effects may cause a PC to lose their quiver entirely, however.*
