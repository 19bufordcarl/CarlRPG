# Thrown

A Thrown weapon means that the wielder can throw the weapon to make a [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md). The wielder *may* substitute all instances of [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md) with [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md) for this attack.

*The default range for this attack is 30'.*
