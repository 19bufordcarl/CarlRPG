# Dual Wield

A *Dual Wield* weapon can be wielded in the wielder's off hand.

While dual wielding, the wielder can [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) with either of their two weapons.

If they hit, they may add the damage dice of their other weapon to the damage dealt from this hit. If they do this, they must end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) immediately after.
