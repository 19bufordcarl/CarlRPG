# Dual Wield

A *Dual Wield* weapon can be wielded in the wielder's off hand â€” see [Two Handed Property](Two%20Handed%20Property.md).

In order to dual wield, the wielder must have [Melee Combat](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Melee%20Combat.md) proficiency.

While dual wielding, the wielder can use their [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) with the off-hand weapon only during their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). This [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) cannot be a [Power Attack](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Power%20Attack.md).
