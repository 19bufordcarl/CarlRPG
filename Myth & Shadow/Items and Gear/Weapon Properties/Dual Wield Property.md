# Dual Wield

A *Dual Wield* weapon can be wielded in the wielder's off hand â€” see [Two Handed Property](Two%20Handed%20Property.md).

While dual wielding and the wielder has an [Expertise Die](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md#Expertise%20Die) for the [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) roll, they also have it for the damage roll.
