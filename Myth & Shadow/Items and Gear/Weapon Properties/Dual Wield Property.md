# Dual Wield

A *Dual Wield* weapon can be wielded in the wielder's off hand â€” see [Two Handed Property](Two%20Handed%20Property.md).

In order to dual wield, the wielder must have [Weaponry](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Weaponry.md) proficiency.

While dual wielding, the wielder can use their [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) with the off-hand weapon.
