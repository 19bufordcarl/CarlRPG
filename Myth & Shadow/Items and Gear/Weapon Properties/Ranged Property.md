# Ranged

A Ranged weapon can be used to make [Ranged Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md) within its specified normal range.

## Range Distance Penalties

If your target is beyond the normal range of your weapon, your attacks have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

In daylight, your weapon's max range is 10x the normal range. Otherwise, it is 2x the normal range. You can only attack targets within your max range.

## Ammo

[Ranged Weapons](../Weapons/Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) require [Ammo](Ammo%20Property.md). You can reload an *Ammo Weapon* as part of the [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) action.
