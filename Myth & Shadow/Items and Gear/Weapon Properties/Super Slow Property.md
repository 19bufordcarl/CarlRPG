# Super Slow

A *Slow* weapon cannot be used to make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) on a [Fast Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Fast%20Turn).

Also, the wielder can either make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) or use their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) on their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), not both.
