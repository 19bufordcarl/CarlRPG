# Coins

Anytime a generic coin is mentioned in this game, it is referring to the Imperial Silver Piece.

Roughly speaking, a coin in this game is worth 1sp in Shadowdark and most BX style games. The economy's in most BX style games do not usually have internally consistent logic.

One silver coin in Mithrinia represents a days wage of standard labor and all prices are derived from that. To convert loot and prices from these systems, you *could* use this table.

| Classic Coinage | Myth & Shadow Coinage |
| --------------- | --------------------: |
| 1cp             |       1/10 coin (1cp) |
| 1sp             |          1 coin (1sp) |
| 1ep             |         5 coins (N/A) |
| 1gp             |        10 coins (1gp) |
| 1pp             |        50 coins (N/A) |
| 10gp            |       100 coins (1mp) |
| Gem (gp)        |             10x coins |

That being said, for prices of items, you should reference the [Items](../Items.md) themselves. The [Detailed Price Master List](Detailed%20Prices/Detailed%20Price%20Master%20List.md) has an expanded list of items.

## Imperial Currency and Availability

| Imperial Coinage   | Equivalent in coins (sp) |
| ------------------ | -----------------------: |
| Copper Piece (cp)  |                     1/10 |
| Silver Piece (sp)  |                        1 |
| Gold Piece (gp)    |                       10 |
| Mythril Piece (mp) |                      100 |

Mithrinia is roughly analogous to the ancient world (roughly circa year 0) except there is access to magic and thus has a bit more 'technology'.

This means the world is not particularly well stocked with currency, minting currency is expensive, and most commoners get by trading favors and food. There are probably only around 10 silver pieces in circulation per person, same with copper pieces. Minting coins is time consuming and copper coins are not used by the elites. Gold pieces are rare, there might only be one gold piece per person in circulation and only 1 Mythril piece per 10 or so people.

In civilization, letters of credit from the authorities (bank or similar) are more space efficient if the party is on good terms with the imperial banks.
