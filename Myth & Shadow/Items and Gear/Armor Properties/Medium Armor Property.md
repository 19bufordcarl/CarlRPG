# Medium Armor

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear *Medium Armor* effectively, you must have a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) of at least 2.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and you gain the [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for longer than 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).

## Penalties

Regardless of whether you meet the requirements, medium armor applies these penalties:

1. You have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks that are not part of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).
2. You sink in water. You make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) every [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.

*See [Drowning](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md#Drowning).*

## Don / Doff

Medium Armor takes 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)) to don / doff.
