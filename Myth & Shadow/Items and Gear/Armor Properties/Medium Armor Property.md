# Medium Armor

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear *Heavy Armor* effectively, the [Median](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of your physical abilities must be at least 2.
*Note: The physical abilities are [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)*.

Alternatively, if [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) or [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) is your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md), your [Median](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) only needs to be 1.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on *all* [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and you gain the [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for longer than 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).

## Penalties

Regardless of whether the wearer meet the requirements, medium armor applies these penalties:

1. The wearer has [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks that are not part of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).
2. The wearer cannot benefit from a bonus to their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) speed.
3. The wearer sinks in water.
	1. The wearer can make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) check every [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.
		1. See [Drowning](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md#Drowning).

*Ignore these penalties if the armor has the [Silvered Property](../Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or the [Mythril Property](../Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md).*

## Don / Doff

Medium Armor takes 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
