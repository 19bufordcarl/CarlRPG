# Light Armor Property

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear *Light Armor* effectively, you must have a [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) of at least 0.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

## Don / Doff

Light Armor takes 1 minute (10 [Combat Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
