# Light Armor Property

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear *Light Armor* effectively, the [Median](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of your *physical* abilities must be at least 0.
*Note: The physical abilities are [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)*.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on *physical* ability [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

## Don / Doff

Light Armor takes 1 minute (10 [Combat Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
