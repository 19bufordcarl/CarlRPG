# Light Armor Property

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md) with this property, you must have non-negative [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) and [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md).

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

## Don / Doff

Light Armor takes 1 minute (10 [Combat Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
