# Shield

## Requirements

In order to wield a *Shield* effectively, you must have a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) of at least 1.

If you do not, you get no [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) bonus from the shield.

Shields require a free hand to wield.

## Don / Doff

Shields take 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to don / doff.

Shields can be donned or doffed as part of another [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) once per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

*Don means wield the shield rather than its typically meaning of wear the armor*
