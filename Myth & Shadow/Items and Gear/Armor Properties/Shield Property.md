# Shield

## Requirements

You need at least 1 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) to benefit from the shield's [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) bonus.

Shields require a free hand to wield.

## Don / Doff

Shields take 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to don / doff.

Shields can be donned or doffed as part of another [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) once per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

*Don means wield the shield rather than its typically meaning of wear the armor*
