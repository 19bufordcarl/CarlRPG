# Shield

## Requirements

In order to wield a *Shield* effectively, you must have a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) of at least 1.

A *Shield* requires a free hand to wield.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you get no [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) bonus from the shield.

## Don / Doff

A Shield takes 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to don / doff.

A Shield can be donned or doffed as part of another [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) once per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## FAQ

If you have a shield in your [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md) and you make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md), you can choose to stow or wield that shield as part of that [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).

If you have a shield in your [Stash](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md), you may take an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to retrieve it and then also don it to wield it as part of that same [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

Don means wield the shield rather than its typically meaning of wearing armor.
