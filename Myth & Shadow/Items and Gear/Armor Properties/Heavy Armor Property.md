# Heavy Armor

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear [Armor](../Armor/Armor.md) with this property, you must have a [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) of:

1. [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) *or*
2. [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)

Additionally, neither of those scores can be negative.

Alternatively, you can wear armor with this property if you have an [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) of *at least* 5 for:

1. [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) *and*
2. [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). Also, you gain the [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for longer than 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).

## Penalties

Regardless of whether the wearer meet the requirements, heavy armor applies these penalties:

1. The wearer has [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks.
	1. Unless it is an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) using a weapon with the [Mechanical Property](../Weapon%20Properties/Mechanical%20Property.md).
2. The wearer cannot benefit from a bonus to their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) speed.
3. The wearer sinks in water.
	1. The wearer can make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) check every [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.
		1. See [Drowning](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md#Drowning).

## Don / Doff

Heavy Armor takes 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
