# Heavy Armor

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear *Heavy Armor* effectively, you must have a [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) of at least 3.

If [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), you must have [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) of at least 2.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and you gain the [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for longer than 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).

## Penalties

Regardless of whether the wearer meets the requirements, heavy armor applies these penalties:

1. The wearer has [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks.
2. The wearer cannot benefit from a bonus to their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) speed.
3. The wearer sinks in water.
	1. The wearer can make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) check every [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.

*See [Drowning](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md#Drowning).*

## Don / Doff

Heavy Armor takes 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
