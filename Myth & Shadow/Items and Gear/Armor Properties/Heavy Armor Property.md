# Heavy Armor

**Worn armor does not take up an [Item Slot](../Item%20Slot.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear *Heavy Armor* effectively, you must have a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) of at least 3.

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and you gain the [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for longer than 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).

## Penalties

Regardless of whether you meet the requirements, heavy armor applies these penalties:

1. You have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks.
2. You cannot benefit from a bonus to your [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) speed.
3. You sink in water.
