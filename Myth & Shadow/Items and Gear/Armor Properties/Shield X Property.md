# Shield X

Shield X is the main property of all shields.

Shields raise the wielders [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by X.

Shields require a one free hand to wield.
*This means they cannot be used with [Two Handed Weapons](../Weapon%20Properties/Two%20Handed%20Property.md) or [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).*

## Requirements

The wielder needs at least 1 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) to benefit from the AC bonus.

## Don / Doff

Shields take 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to don / doff.

Shields can be equipped or unequipped as part of another [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) once per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).
