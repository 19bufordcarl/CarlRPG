# Adventurer's Pack

**Every adventurer needs this basic gear.**

It comes with:

- A backpack
- A waterskin
- A ration kit
- A coin pouch
- A bedroll

This gives you access to your [Stash](../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md). It does not take an [Equipment Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment%20Slot.md).

You need this gear to [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
