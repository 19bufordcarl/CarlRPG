# Adventurer's Pack

**Every adventurer needs this basic gear.** Comes with
- A backpack
- A waterskin
- A coin pouch (so your first 500 coins does not take up an [Item Slot](../../Item%20Slot.md))
- A bedroll

Your first pack does not take up [Item Slot](../../Item%20Slot.md). It gives you access to your [Inventory](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Inventory.md).

| Quantity of Item | Item Slots | Price |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1                | --         | 100   |
