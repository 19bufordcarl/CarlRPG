# Adventurer's Pack

**Every adventurer needs this basic gear.** Comes with
- A backpack
- A waterskin
- A coin pouch (so your first 500 coins does not take up an [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md))
- A bedroll

Your first pack does not take up [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md). A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has 10 [Item Slots](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).

| Quantity of Item | Item Slots | Price |

| 1                | --         | 100   |
