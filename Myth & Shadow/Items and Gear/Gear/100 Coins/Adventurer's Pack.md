# Adventurer's Pack

**Every adventurer needs this basic gear.** Comes with
- A backpack
- A waterskin
- A coin pouch (so your first 500 coins does not take up an [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md))
- A bedroll

Your first pack does not take up [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md). A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has a number of [Item Slots](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md) equal to the [Median](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of their [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md).
