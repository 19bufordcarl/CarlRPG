# Wagon

A nice sized 4 wheeled cart.

- Must be pulled by a [Horse](Horse,%20Draft.md)
- Can carry all the PCs (~6)
- Can hold any number of items that take up 20 or fewer [Item Slots](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).
	- If it gets unwieldy, the GM can impose a 100 item slot limit.
	- Larger items will not fit in the wagon.

| Quantity of Item | Item Slots | Price |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1                | --         | 250   |
