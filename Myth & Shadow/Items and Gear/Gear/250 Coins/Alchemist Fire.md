# Alchemist Fire

A potion of [Fireball](../../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%203/Fireball.md), but it only does 1d6 [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.

These can be crafted by a PC provided that:

1. They have [Fire](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) as a [Learned Domain](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md).
2. They use 200 coins of [Mythril](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Mythril.md).
3. They have access to a [Glass Vial](../10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md), and an [Alchemist Kit](../100%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar.
4. Each vial takes a [Break](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md) to craft.

See [Potion Rules](../../../Magic/Crafting/Potion%20Rules.md).
