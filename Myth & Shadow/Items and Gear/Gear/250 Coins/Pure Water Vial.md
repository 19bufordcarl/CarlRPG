# Pure Water Vial

When applied to an [Undead](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) or [Demon](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Demon.md), they take 1d6 [Pure](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage. They take this damage again at the start of their next [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

When drunk by a PC while [Recovering](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover), they restore all their [HP](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) and are no longer [Wounded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

When drunk by a PC in [Combat](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md), they restore 1 [HP](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) and are no longer [Wounded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

These can be crafted by a PC provided that:

1. They have [Life](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md) or [Water](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md) as a [Learned Domain](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md).
2. They use 200 coins of [Mythril](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Mythril.md).
3. They have access to water, a [Glass Vial](../10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md), and an [Alchemist Kit](../50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar.
4. Each vial takes a [Delve Round](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to craft.
