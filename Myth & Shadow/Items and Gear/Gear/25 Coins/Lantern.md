# Lantern

When the oil is lit, it illuminates out for 60 feet and lasts until it is snuffed out.

The illuminated area is not in [Darkness](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md).

Lighting a lantern requires 1 [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), an [Oil Vial](../10%20Coins/Oil%20Vial.md), a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md), and — if [Blinded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) — a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

Lanterns have a shutter that can be used to hide its light without extinguishing it as an [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

Lanterns can be affixed to your pack so that they do not use a free hand.
