# Makeup Kit

A collection of cosmetics. 

You can use this kit and a [Break](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md) to disguise a creature.

A creature can inspect this disguise once per encounter. The user of the kit makes a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) where XX is 10 + their [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md). On a failure, the creature sees through the disguise.
