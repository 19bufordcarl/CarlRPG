# Makeup Kit

A collection of cosmetics.

You can use this kit to disguise a creature when you take a [Break](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md).

An NPC can inspect this disguise once per encounter. The GM rolls the [Oracle Die](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Oracle%20Die.md). If the PC's [Background](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Background.md) would give them experience in makeup, they can re-roll this die once.
