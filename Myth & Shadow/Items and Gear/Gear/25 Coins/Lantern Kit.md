# Lantern Kit

This kit contains a lantern, flint, steel, and a store of lantern oil.

## Lantern

A lit lantern illuminates out for 1 [Zone](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) and lasts until it is snuffed out â€” see [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).

The illuminated area is not in [Darkness](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md).

Lighting a lantern takes an [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), and, if in [Combat](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md), a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Stamina](../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Survival](../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Survival.md)) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

Lanterns have a shutter that can be used to hide its light without extinguishing it as a [Reaction](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md).

Lanterns can be affixed to your pack so that they do not use a free hand.
