# Simple Instrument

Let's the wielder make a [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) to amuse listeners.

There is no standard benefit to this, though some NPCs like music.

*Examples include a wooden flute, a bell, etc.*
