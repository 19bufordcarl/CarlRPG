# Simple Instrument

Let's the wielder make a [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) check with [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) to amuse listeners.

- There is no standard benefit to this, though some creatures and NPCs like music.

Examples include a wooden flute, a bell, etc.
