# Oil Vial

A small glass container full of oil.

It can be used for:

- 1 hour of [Lantern](../25%20Coins/Lantern.md) light.
- 2 rounds of [Burning](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) on a doused creature.

When empty, it just becomes a [Glass Vial](Glass%20Vial.md). It can be refilled for 1 coin.
