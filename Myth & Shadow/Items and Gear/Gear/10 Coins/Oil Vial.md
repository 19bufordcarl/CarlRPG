# Oil Vial

A small glass container full of oil.

It can be used for:

- 1 hour of [Lantern](../25%20Coins/Lantern.md) light.
- Start [Burning](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) with [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) on a doused target.
	- You can use an [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to douse an [Engaged](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) target.
	- A [Tinderbox](Tinderbox.md) or any [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage ignites the doused target.

When empty, it just becomes a [Glass Vial](Glass%20Vial.md). It can be refilled for 1 coin.
