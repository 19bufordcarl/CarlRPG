# Oil Vial

A small glass container full of oil. It can be used for 1 hour of [Lantern](../25%20Coins/Lantern.md) light, or 2 rounds of a 5 foot [Aura](../../../Magic/Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) of [Burning](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Environmental%20Hazards.md#Burning) if lit on [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md).

When empty, it just becomes a [Glass Vial](Glass%20Vial.md). It can be refilled for 1 coin.
