# Iron Pitons

A set of iron spikes with holes for threading rope. Can be hammered into most stone walls.

When rope is threaded through them, this allows creatures to make a [Stamina](../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to climb an otherwise unclimbable wall. If the wall is climbable, it grants [Advantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

*The [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is dependent on the wall â€” default of 10.*
