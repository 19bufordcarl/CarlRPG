# Iron Pitons

A set of iron spikes with holes for threading rope. Can be hammered into most stone walls.

When rope is threaded through them, this allows creatures to make a [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) or [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to climb an otherwise unclimbable wall. If the wall is climbable, it grants [Advantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

[DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 is the difficulty of climbing the average stone wall.
