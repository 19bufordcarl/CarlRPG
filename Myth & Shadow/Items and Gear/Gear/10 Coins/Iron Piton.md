# Iron Piton

An iron spike with a hole for threading rope. Can be hammered into most stone walls.

When rope is threaded through them, this allows creatures to make climbing [Checks](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

If the wall was already climbable, these [Checks](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) have [Advantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).
