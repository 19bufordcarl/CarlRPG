# Candle

Lasts for 1 hour. Illuminates out 5 feet.

- Areas affected by the [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) are still *Deadly*, candlelight is not enough.
- Does not provide enough light to [Search](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Search) in the [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).
- Is extinguished when the PC runs, falls, or otherwise moves quickly.
- Needs a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md) to ignite.

*Candles are bad light sources, they are a last resort.*
