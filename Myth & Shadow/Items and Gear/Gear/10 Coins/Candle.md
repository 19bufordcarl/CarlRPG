# Candle

Lasts for 1 hour. Illuminates everything [Engaged](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

In [Shadowcursed Darkness](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Shadowcursed%20Darkness), a candle does not provide enough light to [Search](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Search) and the danger level still counts as deadly for the [Delving Hazard Die](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) and [Journey Hazard Die](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Journey%20Hazard%20Die).

Lighting a candle requires 1 [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md), and — if [Blinded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) — a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

A candle is extinguished when the PC runs, falls, or otherwise moves quickly.

*Candles are bad light sources, they are a last resort.*
