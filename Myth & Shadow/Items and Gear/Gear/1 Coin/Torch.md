# Torch

A lit torch illuminates out for 1 [Zone](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) and lasts until it is snuffed out â€” see [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).

The illuminated area is not in [Darkness](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md).

Lighting a torch requires:

- 1 [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) and a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md) as [Equipment](../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md).
- If you are [Blinded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md), need you to make a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) too.

Three torches of materials is enough for a campfire that is suitable for a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

Torches require a free hand to wield.
