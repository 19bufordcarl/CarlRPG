# Torch

When lit on fire, it illuminates out for 30 feet.

- Lighting a torch requires 1 [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).
	- Needs a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md) to ignite.
- The light lasts for 1 hour.

Three torches of materials is enough for an 8 hour campfire instead, suitable for a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
