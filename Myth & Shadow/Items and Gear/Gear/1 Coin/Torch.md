# Torch

When lit on fire, it illuminates out for 30 feet.

- Lighting a torch requires 1 [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) and a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) if [Blinded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md).
- Need a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md) to ignite.
- The light lasts for 1 hour.

Three torches of materials is enough for an 8 hour campfire instead, suitable for a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
