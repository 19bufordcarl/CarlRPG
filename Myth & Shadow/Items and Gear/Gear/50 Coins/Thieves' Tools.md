# Thieves' Tools

A lock pick kit and some long metal probes.

These tools allow the wielder to make a [Stamina](../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to disarm certain locks and traps.

You have [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on this [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) unless you are trained in thievery.

*The [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is dependent on the lock / trap â€” default of 15.*
