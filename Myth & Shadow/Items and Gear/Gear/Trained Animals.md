# Trained Animals

PCs can have a number of trained animals equal to the higher of their [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) or [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md).

Animals do not take up item slots, they travel with you.

Animals act on your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Initiative.md).
