# Trained Animals

PCs can have a number of trained animals equal to the greater of their [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) and [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md).

Trained animals act on your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Initiative.md).

If you have multiple dogs, they [Move](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) and [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) together, making only one attack roll. A hit does all of their damage combined.
