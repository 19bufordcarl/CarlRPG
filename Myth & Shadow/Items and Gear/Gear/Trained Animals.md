# Trained Animals

PCs can have a number of trained animals equal to the higher of their [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) or [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md).

Animals do not take up item slots, they travel with you.

Animals act on your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Initiative.md). If you have multiple dogs, they move and attack together and make one attack roll together. A hit does all of their damage combined.

| Animal                                          | Cost |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| [Dog, Trained](25%20Coins/Dog,%20Trained.md)    |   25 |
| [Bird, Trained](100%20Coins/Bird,%20Trained.md) |  100 |
| [Horse, Draft](250%20Coins/Horse,%20Draft.md)   |  250 |
| [Horse, War](1000%20Coins/Horse,%20War.md)      | 1000 |

The party's wagon draft horse does not use up an animal companion "slot".

*Note: You may re-flavor these animals to fit the campaign setting.*
