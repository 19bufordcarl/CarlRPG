# Shield X

Shield is the main property of all shields.

- Shields require a one free hand to wield.
	- This means they cannot be used with [Two Handed Weapons](../../Weapon%20Properties/Two%20Handed%20Property.md) or [Spellcasting](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Casting%20Movement%20and%20Noise).
- Shields raise the wielders [Armor Class](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by X.

## Requirements

If the wielder does not a positive [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), they do not gain the AC bonus.

## Don / Doff

Shields take 1 [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to don / doff.
