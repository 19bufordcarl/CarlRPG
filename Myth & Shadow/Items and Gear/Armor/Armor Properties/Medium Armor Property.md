# Medium Armor

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear [Armor](../Armor.md) with this property, you must have a [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) of:

1. [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md) *or*
2. [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Constitution.md)

Alternatively, you can wear armor with this property if you have an [Ability Score](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Ability%20Scores.md) of *at least* 3 for:

1. [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md) *and*
2. [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Constitution.md)

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). Also, you gain the [Exhausted](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for longer than 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).

## Penalties

Regardless of whether the wearer meet the requirements, medium armor applies these penalties:

1. The wearer has [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md) checks that are not part of an [Attack](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).
2. The wearer cannot benefit from a bonus to their [Movement](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) speed.
3. The wearer sinks in water.
	1. The wearer can make a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md) check every [Round](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.
		1. See [Drowning](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md#Drowning).

*Ignore these penalties if the armor has the [Silvered Property](../../Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or the [Mythril Property](../../Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md).*

## Don / Doff

Medium Armor takes 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) unless the item states otherwise.
