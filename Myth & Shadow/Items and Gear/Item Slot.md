# Item Slot

An item slot is used as the unit of abstraction of [Inventory](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Inventory.md) for the purpose of making managing inventory streamlined and enjoyable for gameplay.

Something that takes up an item slot weighs about 5 pounds or is about as big as a bike helmet.

Smaller [Items](Items.md) of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. Common examples are:

- 10 iron spikes or candles
- 20 pieces of ammunition ([Arrow](Weapons/Ammo/Arrow.md), [Bolt](Weapons/Ammo/Bolt.md), [Sling Stone](Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md))
- 500 [Coins](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Coins.md)
	- *(Always [Rounding](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Rounding) down means the first 500 takes up 0 slots)*
- 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../Magic/Spellcasting/Mythril.md) powder
	- *(Goes with coins in your "pouches" free slot)*
