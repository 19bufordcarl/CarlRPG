## Sheathes

These weapon prices and [Equipment Slots](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment%20Slot.md) include their sheathes.

## Quivers

Ranged weapons come with an empty quiver. A quiver itself does not take up a slot, it is just storage space. Only the ammo takes up slots. Each quiver can hold 1 slot of ammo.

You can regain all nearby spent ammo when you [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover).
