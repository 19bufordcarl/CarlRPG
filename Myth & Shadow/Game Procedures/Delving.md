# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, like the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), but not currently engaged in combat (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered [Delving](Delving.md).

While [Delving](Delving.md), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour. 

When delving, each PC gets a delve [Turn](Turn.md) to do stuff that takes ~5 min, called a [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action). When each PC has had a chance to do this, the referee takes the Dungeon [Turn](Turn.md) (moving any monsters, shifting the environment, adjusting timers, etc.) and then the next [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round) starts.

According to the danger level, roll the delving hazard die at the end of a [Round](Round.md). On a 1, there is an encounter.
## Delving Hazard Die

| Danger Level | Hazard Die Roll |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Normal       | d20             |
| Risky        | d12             |
| Deadly       | d6              |
## Delve Movement
The movement action is the primary action PCs will take when delving. The referee describes all the immediately obvious things about the environment they are in after moving, from which the players will choose how to interact with any relevant creatures or features of the environment.

There are 3 movement speeds when delving.
### Delve (Default)
The PCs normal [Movement](Movement.md) per delve [Round](Round.md). At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](Initiative.md). You can spend a [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action) to [Dash](Movement.md#Dash) and still retain these benefits. 
#### Walk
1,000 feet (200 five-foot squares) per [Round](Round.md). At walking speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters and spring all traps.
#### Run
5,000 feet (1000 five-foot squares) per [Round](Round.md). At running speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. PCs can run for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) before needing to [Walk](Delving.md#Walk) for a [Round](Round.md). Candles go out when running.
## Recover
Another major delve action is to recover. When a PC spends a round recovering, they regain [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d4 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). PCs can spend multiple rounds recovering in a row to get back to full FP.

You also recover any reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed / lost.
## Searching
The last major delve action is to search. Searching reveals any hidden features, things that are not immediately obvious, but would reasonably be found by a group of people taking 5 minutes to look around carefully.
#### Hidden Features
A PC can use an [Action](Action.md) to search a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a loose brick, a cracked tile, etc.) This cannot be done with only [Candle](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Candle.md) light, they are treated as secret features.
#### Secret Features
Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have clues, but can only be found through the players describing the PCâ€™s actions.
