# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, like the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), but not currently engaged in combat (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered [Delving](Delving.md).

While [Delving](Delving.md), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour. 
## Tracking Turns
### Real Time Turns
*(Recommended)*
The referee uses a real timer (stopwatch) set for 6 minutes which tracks a [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round). The referee should be descriptive but concise when describing the environment. This is a hazardous environment and time pressure serves to reinforce that reality. While in combat, the timer is stopped.

If the players wish to do something that will take more time, the referee simply states how many [Delve Rounds](Round.md#Delve%20Round) the [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action) will take.

At the end of each [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round), the referee makes the appropriate number of [Delving Hazard Die](Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) rolls, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.
### Initiative Turns
*(Not Recommended)*
When delving, PCs are tracked in [Delving](Delving.md) [Initiative](Initiative.md). 

Each PC makes a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and the PC with the highest roll goes first. Play passes to the left. Each PC gets a [Delving](Delving.md) [Turn](Turn.md) to do stuff that takes ~5 min, called a [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action). When each PC has had a chance to do this, the referee takes the Dungeon [Turn](Turn.md) (moving any monsters, shifting the environment, adjusting timers, etc.) and then the next [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round) starts.
## Delving Hazard Die
According to the danger level, roll the delving hazard die at the end of a [Round](Round.md). On a result of 1, there is an encounter.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die Roll |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Normal       | d20             |
| Risky        | d12             |
| Deadly       | d6              |
### Encounter Distance and Reaction
The encounter monsters are placed at a random direction at the edge of the PCs vision. By default, a d12 with the result interpreted as the clockwise direction determines the direction of their placement. The [Monster Reactions](../Social%20Systems/Monster%20Reactions.md) roll should be used if the reaction is unclear.
## Delve Movement
The movement action is the primary action PCs will take when delving. The referee describes all the immediately obvious things about the environment they are in after moving, from which the players will choose how to interact with any relevant creatures or features of the environment.

There are 3 movement speeds when delving.
### Delve (Default)
The PCs normal [Movement](Movement.md) per delve [Round](Round.md). At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](Initiative.md). You can spend a [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action) to [Dash](Movement.md#Dash) and still retain these benefits. 
#### Walk
1,000 feet (200 five-foot squares) per [Round](Round.md). At walking speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters and spring all traps.
#### Run
5,000 feet (1000 five-foot squares) per [Round](Round.md). At running speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. PCs can run for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) before needing to [Walk](Delving.md#Walk) for a [Round](Round.md). Candles go out when running.
## Recover
Another major delve action is to recover. When a PC spends a round recovering, they regain [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d4 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). PCs can spend multiple rounds recovering in a row to get back to full FP.

You also recover any reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed / lost.
## Searching
The last major delve action is to search. Searching reveals any hidden features, things that are not immediately obvious, but would reasonably be found by a group of people taking 5 minutes to look around carefully.
#### Hidden Features
A PC can use an [Action](Action.md) to search a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a loose brick, a cracked tile, etc.) This cannot be done with only [Candle](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Candle.md) light, they are treated as secret features.
#### Secret Features
Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have clues, but can only be found through the players describing the PCâ€™s actions.
