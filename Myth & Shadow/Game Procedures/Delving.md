# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, like the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), but not currently engaged in combat (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered [Delving](Delving.md).

While [Delving](Delving.md), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour. 
## Tracking Turns
### Real Time Turns
*(Default Rule)*
The GM uses a real timer (stopwatch) set for 6 minutes which tracks a [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round). The GM should be descriptive but concise when describing the environment. This is a hazardous environment and the time pressure mechanic reinforces that reality. While in combat, this timer is stopped.

If the players wish to do something that will take more time, the GM simply states how many [Delve Rounds](Round.md#Delve%20Round) the [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action) will take. If the players wish to proceed with this action, the GM then takes the appropriate number of [Dungeon Turns](Delving.md#Dungeon%20Turns).
### Dungeon Turns
The GM's turn is also called the dungeon turn. This happens at the end of each [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round). During it, the GM makes the appropriate number of [Delving Hazard Die](Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) rolls, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.
### Initiative Turns
*(Optional Rule: Not Recommended)*
When delving, you can track PC turns in [Delving](Delving.md) [Initiative](Initiative.md). 

Each PC makes a d20 roll and the PC with the highest roll goes first. Play passes to the left. Each PC gets a [Delving](Delving.md) [Turn](Turn.md) to do stuff that takes ~5 min, called a [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action). When each PC has taken a [Turn](Turn.md), the GM then takes the [Dungeon Turn](Delving.md#Dungeon%20Turns).
## Delving Hazard Die
According to the danger level, roll the delving hazard die at the end of a [Round](Round.md). On a result of 1, there is an encounter.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die Roll |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Normal       | d20             |
| Risky        | d12             |
| Deadly       | d6              |
### Encounter Distance and Reaction
The encounter monsters are placed at a random direction at the edge of the PCs vision. By default, a d12 with the result interpreted as the clockwise direction determines the direction of their placement. The [Monster Reactions](../Social%20Systems/Monster%20Reactions.md) roll should be used if the reaction is unclear.
## Primary Delve Actions
### Recover
One primary delve action is to recover. When a PC spends a round recovering, they regain [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d4 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). PCs can spend multiple rounds recovering in a row to get back to full FP.

You also recover any reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed / lost.
### Searching
One primary delve action is to search. Searching reveals any hidden features. These are things that are not immediately obvious, but would reasonably be found by a group of people taking roughly 5 minutes to look around carefully.
#### Hidden Features
A PC can use an [Action](Action.md) to search a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a loose brick, a cracked tile, etc.) If there is only [Candle](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Candle.md) light, this takes 2 rounds.
#### Secret Features
Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have clues, but can only be found through the players describing the PCâ€™s actions. The GM may have the PCs roll an investigation [Check](Check.md) to determine what clue they get, but they should always get a clue.
## Delve Movement
Each PC gets delve movement in addition to their delve action when playing in [Initiative Turns](Delving.md#Initiative%20Turns) while delving. If playing in [Real Time Turns](Delving.md#Real%20Time%20Turns), then the GM should only use this when the PCs wish to move back through areas they have already described. The GM will not be describing the rooms again, and so this will use much less real time than it ought to.

When the move action is taken, the GM describes all the immediately obvious things about the environment they are in after moving, from which the players will choose how to interact with any relevant creatures or features of the environment.

There are 3 movement speeds when delving.
### Delve Speed (Default)
The PCs normal [Movement](Movement.md) per delve [Round](Round.md). At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](Initiative.md). You can spend a [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action) to [Dash](Movement.md#Dash), doubling your [Movement](Movement.md), and still retain these benefits.
#### Walk
1,000 feet (200 five-foot squares) per [Round](Round.md). At walking speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters and spring all traps. This takes a PCs delve action.
#### Run
5,000 feet (1000 five-foot squares) per [Round](Round.md). At running speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. PCs can run for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) before needing to [Walk](Delving.md#Walk) for a [Round](Round.md). Candles go out when running. This takes a PCs delve action.
