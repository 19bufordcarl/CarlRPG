# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

All the PCs make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and the referee rolls for each enemy. Whoever rolls highest goes first. When it is the PCs turn, play passes to the left, skipping the referee until all PCs have gone. Then the referee acts for all the enemies.

If a PC wishes to wait until another PC goes, they can use the “ready [Action](Action.md)”.

Once all combatants have taken a turn, that round ends and the next round begins, returning to the side who won the high roll.

*Enemies will take [Reactions](Reaction.md) on the players turns, combat should always feel like a responsive back and forth*
## Always On Initiative
*Optional Rule: Depends*
You can have initiative always be tracked and roll a new initiative every time combat starts and ends. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally. This is a good to help newer or more timid players have a dedicated time where they have the spotlight without needing them to take the 'initiative'.

*When delving, treat the referees turn as the dungeon turn, rolling any dice, updating any parts of the environment, adjusting timers, etc.*

## Average Roll (Referee only)
*Optional Rule: Recommended for 3+ enemies*
When there are a lot of enemies, the referee using the average roll can be much faster than roller a bunch of d20s. The following table has those averages. You can then simply add the dexterity of the creatures to get the average highest initiative roll. (Rounded down)
### Recommended Averages (Easy to memorize)

| Number of Enemies | Average Highest d20 Roll |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 3-6               | 15                       |
| 7+                | 18                       |
### Exact Table

| Number of Enemies | Average Highest d20 Roll |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1                 | 10                       |
| 2                 | 13                       |
| 3                 | 15                       |
| 4                 | 16                       |
| 5-7               | 17                       |
| 8+                | 18                       |
This simulates the danger that large groups of enemies pose, since going first is very valuable in a turn based game where encounters do not typically last more than 5-10 rounds.
