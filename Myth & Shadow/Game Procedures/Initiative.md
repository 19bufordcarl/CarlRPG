# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

"Order" will mean descending order for the purposes of initiative.

## Default Initiative Procedure

1. All combatants roll a d20 and add their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) to determine their *initiative*.
	1. *Optional:* For large groups of NPCs, the GM may simply use 10 + their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) (average).
2. Starting with the highest *initiative*, each combatant takes their [Turn](Turn.md) in *initiative* order.
3. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](Turn.md), you go back to the highest *initiative* and the next [Round](Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the "[Ready Action](Reaction.md#Ready)".

## Simplified Initiative

*Optional Rule: Recommended if playing without computers.*

### Simplified Initiative Procedure

1. Start with the highest [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) combatant, each combatant takes their [Turn](Turn.md) in order.
	1. Level tie resolutions:
		1. Between PCs and NPCs:
			1. Roll a d6:
				1. On a 4 or higher, the PCs win ties this combat.
				2. On a 3 or lower, the PCs lose ties this combat.
		2. Between PCs, choose one:
			1. Left is law
				1. Start with the PC to the GM's left, play passes to the left.
			2. Simultaneous
				1. All PCs of the same level may take their turn simultaneously.
		3. For NPCs, the GM can choose any order they desire, including simultaneous.
2. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](Turn.md), you go back to the highest [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) combatant and the next [Round](Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the "[Ready Action](Reaction.md#Ready)".

# Always On Initiative

*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
You can have initiative always be tracked and always take turns. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally. This can help some newer or more timid players to have a dedicated time where they have the spotlight without needing them to take the 'initiative'.
