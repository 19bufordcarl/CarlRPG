# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

All the PCs and enemies make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and go in order of their result starting with the highest roll. Once all creatures have gone the [Round](Round.md) ends and you go back to the creature with the highest roll and repeat.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the “ready [Action](Action.md)”.

*Enemies and Players can also take [Reactions](Reaction.md) on the each others turns, combat should always feel like a responsive back and forth, never just a waiting game.*
## Always On Initiative
*Optional Rule: Depends*
You can have initiative always be tracked and roll a new initiative every time combat starts and ends. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally. This is a good to help newer or more timid players have a dedicated time where they have the spotlight without needing them to take the 'initiative'.

*When delving, treat the referees turn as the dungeon turn, rolling any dice, updating any parts of the environment, adjusting timers, etc.*

## Average Roll (Referee only)
*Optional Rule: Recommended for 3+ enemies*
When there are a lot of enemies, the referee using the average roll can be much faster than roller a bunch of d20s. The following table has those averages. You can then simply add the dexterity of the creatures to get the average highest initiative roll. (Rounded down)
### Recommended Averages (Easy to memorize)

| Number of Enemies | Average Highest d20 Roll |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 3-6               | 15                       |
| 7+                | 18                       |
### Exact Table

| Number of Enemies | Average Highest d20 Roll |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1                 | 10                       |
| 2                 | 13                       |
| 3                 | 15                       |
| 4                 | 16                       |
| 5-7               | 17                       |
| 8+                | 18                       |
This simulates the danger that large groups of enemies pose, since going first is very valuable in a turn based game where encounters do not typically last more than 5-10 rounds.
