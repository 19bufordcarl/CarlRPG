# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

## Default Initiative Procedure

1. All combatants roll a d20 and add their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) to determine their initiative.
2. Starting with the highest initiative, and proceeding in descending order, each combatant takes their [Turn](Turn.md).
3. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](Turn.md), you go back to the highest initiative and the next [Round](Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the "[Ready](Reaction.md#Ready) Action".

*Enemies and Players can take [Reactions](Reaction.md) on any turn, combat should always feel like a responsive back and forth, never just a waiting game.*

## Simplified Initiative

*Optional Rule: Recommended if playing without computers.*

### Simplified Initiative Procedure

1. Start with the highest [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) combatant, and proceeding in descending order, each combatant takes their [Turn](Turn.md).
	1. Tie resolutions:
		1. Between PCs and NPCs:
			1. Roll a d6:
				1. On a 4 or higher, the PCs win ties this combat.
				2. On a 3 or lower, the PCs lose ties this combat.
		2. Between PCs, choose one:
			1. Starting with the PC to the GM's left, proceed in turn order, passing to the left.
			2. All PCs of the same level may take their turn simultaneously.
		3. Between NPCs, the GM can choose any order they desire, including simultaneous.
2. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](Turn.md), you go back to the highest [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) combatant and the next [Round](Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the "[Ready](Reaction.md#Ready) Action".

## Always On Initiative

*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
You can have initiative always be tracked and always take turns. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally. This can help some newer or more timid players to have a dedicated time where they have the spotlight without needing them to take the 'initiative'.
