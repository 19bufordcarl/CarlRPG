# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

"Order" will mean descending order for the purposes of initiative.

## Initiative Procedure

1. All PCs roll a d20 and add their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) to determine their *initiative*.
	1. For NPCs, the GM uses 10 + their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
2. Starting with the highest *initiative*, each combatant takes their [Turn](Turn.md) in *initiative* order.
3. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](Turn.md), you go back to the highest *initiative* and the next [Round](Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the "[Ready Action](Reaction.md#Ready)".
