# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).
## Default Initiative Procedure
1. All combatants roll a d20 and add their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) to determine their initiative score. 
2. Starting with the highest initiative score, and proceeding in order, each combatant takes their [Turn](Turn.md). 
3. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](Turn.md), you go back to the highest score and the next [Round](Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the “[Ready](Reaction.md#Ready) Action”.

*Enemies and Players can take [Reactions](Reaction.md) on any turn, combat should always feel like a responsive back and forth, never just a waiting game.*
## Side Based Initiative
*Optional Rule: Recommended if playing without computers.*
In side based initiative, each player still gets their individual [Turn](Turn.md), but rather than each unit in a combat having their own initiative, it is either the PCs [Turn](Turn.md) or the GM's [Turn](Turn.md). This is determined as follows:
### Side Based Initiative Procedure
1. All PCs roll a d20 and add their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) to determine their initiative score. 
2. The enemy's initiative score is equal to 10 + the highest [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) enemy. 
3. PCs that meet or beet the enemy's initiative score may take a [Turn](Turn.md) before the enemy's act.
4. Then the GM takes their [Turn](Turn.md)
5. Then it is the [Turn](Turn.md) of all the PCs who rolled below the enemy's initiative score. 
6. Then the [Round](Round.md) ends and the next round starts. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the “[Ready](Reaction.md#Ready) Action”.
## Always On Initiative
*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
You can have initiative always be tracked and always take turns. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally. This can help some newer or more timid players to have a dedicated time where they have the spotlight without needing them to take the 'initiative'.
