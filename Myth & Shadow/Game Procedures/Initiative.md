# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](Turn.md) order for the [Round](Round.md).

All the PCs and enemies go in order of their [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) score starting with the highest. Once all creatures have gone, the [Round](Round.md) ends and you go back to the creature with the highest [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

The referee rolls a d6 at the start of each combat. On a 4-6, players win [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) ties. On a 1-3, enemies win [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) ties. This applies for the whole [Combat](Combat.md). Players and enemies with equal [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) scores takes their turns together.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the “ready [Action](Action.md)”.

*Enemies and Players can take [Reactions](Reaction.md) on any turn, combat should always feel like a responsive back and forth, never just a waiting game.*

## Always On Initiative
*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
You can have initiative always be tracked and always take turns. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally. This can help some newer or more timid players to have a dedicated time where they have the spotlight without needing them to take the 'initiative'.
