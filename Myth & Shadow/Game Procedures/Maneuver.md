# Maneuver

Maneuver's represent a catch all for [Actions](Action.md) that a creature wishes to take that is not defined elsewhere in the rules. The rules for resolving maneuvers are as follows.

## When can a creature perform a maneuver?
- When a creature is making an [Attack](Attack.md).
	- [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) / [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) etc. cannot be used for maneuvers, magic does what it does.

	- The maneuver can use items not normally used for an [Attack](Attack.md), provided you *could* [Attack](Attack.md).
		- *Ex. A guard attempting to shackle a PC would be a maneuver, they have a weapon handy. The PC could choose to be [Restrained](../Conditions/Restrained.md), or take the damage, "you resist and the guard hits you with his club"*

- Any time before the damage from that attack is applied to the creature.
	- Before the attack / spell check, after that check, before damage rolled, after damage is rolled, etc. So long as it is before the referee applies the damage.

	- "Applying damage" means once the referee gives the PCs otherwise hidden information about the consequences of that damage *(It kills them, is a [Morale Breaking Point](../Social%20Systems/Morale%20System.md#Breaking%20Points), etc.)*
## How are maneuver's resolved?
The 'attacker' proposes the maneuver / effect they would like to impose on the target ***instead*** of the damage and other effects (such as [Conditions](../Conditions/!Conditions.md)) of the attack. The target chooses whether to take the damage as normal, or suffer the effect of the maneuver.
## What kind of maneuver's can creatures do?
A creature can propose any maneuver. However; 
- If the maneuver is clearly better than the damage rolled, the target (either the PC, or the NPC as judged by the referee) will just choose to take the damage instead.

- If the maneuver is deemed impossible by the referee, the damage is taken instead.
