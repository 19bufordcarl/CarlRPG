# Maneuver

Maneuver's represent a catch all for [[Combat]] [[Action|Actions]] that a PC wishes to take that is not defined elsewhere in the rules. The rules for resolving maneuvers are as follows.

## When can a PC perform a maneuver?
- A PC can only perform a maneuver when they going to do damage to an enemy.
	- [[Melee Attack]], [[Ranged Attack]], [[../Magic/Spellcasting|Spellcasting]], etc.
- A PC can describe the maneuver they wish to perform at any time on their [[Turn]] before the damage from that attack is applied to the creature
	- Before the attack / spell check, after that check, before damage rolled, after damage is rolled but before the referee applies the damage 
		- "Applying damage" means once the referee gives the PCs otherwise hidden information about the consequences of that damage 
			- It kills them, causes them to flee, etc.
## How are maneuver's resolved?
The PC proposes the maneuver / effect the would like to impose on the target ***instead*** of the damage of the attack. The target (controlled by the referee) chooses whether to take the damage as normal, or suffer the effect of the maneuver.

## What kind of maneuver's can the PCs do?
The PCs can propose any maneuver. However, if the maneuver is clearly better than the damage rolled, the target (as judge by the referee) will just choose to take the damage instead.

This method is inspired from the OddSkullBlog, known affectionitely as the "you cut I choose" rule. It is in reference to the method of sharing a piece of cake that whoever decides how to cut the cake, (the maneuver or the damage) does not get to choose the slice they get. This encourages self interested parties to be as fair as possible, because they know that if the cut one slice clearly bigger, then they will get the smaller slice. This also removes the hassle of needing needlessly detailed rules for maneuvers as it leverages the existing rules for damage and als
