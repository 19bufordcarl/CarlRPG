# Melee Attack

To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

## Damage

On a successful [Check](Check.md):

- Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../Items/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die and add 1 + [Half](Half.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).

On a failed [Check](Check.md):

- You may end your [Turn](Turn.md) to deal damage equal to 1 + [Half](Half.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).
	- This is known as a [Melee Bash](Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash).
	- No die roll is made, the damage is flat.
- Otherwise, the attack deals **no damage**.
	- *If the result was greater than or equal to 10, it glances harmlessly off their armor*
	- *If the result was less than 10, the attack is parried or evaded*

On a [Critical Failure](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md), you [Critical Miss](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md).

## Melee Range

Melee attacks have a range of 5' (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.

## Improvised Weapons

Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to 1 + [Half](Half.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) on a successful [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) against [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), and no damage on a failure.

## Melee Bash

- When you fail a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md) roll, you can perform a quick secondary attack against your foe.
	- You deal damage equal to 1 + [Half](Half.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md), no roll required.
		- You may use [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) if wielding a [Finesse](../Items/Weapon%20Properties/Finesse%20Property.md) weapon.
	- If it was a [Critical Miss](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md), then you **cannot** *Melee Bash*.
- Using a *Melee Bash* requires that you end your [Turn](Turn.md) immediately. You cannot say you attack, then miss, and then say you want to do something before you *Melee Bash*.
