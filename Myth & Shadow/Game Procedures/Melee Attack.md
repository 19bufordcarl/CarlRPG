# Melee Attack
To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
## Damage
Roll the damage die of the [Weapon](../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) used to make the attack. Add your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) to this die roll to get the damage dealt.

If you failed the [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md), this damage is halved (rounded down).
## Melee Range
Melee attacks have a range of 5â€™ (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.
## Improvised Weapons
Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal 1 + [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) damage halved (rounded down) unless otherwise noted.
