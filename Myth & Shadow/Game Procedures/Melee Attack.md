# Melee Attack
To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). 
- *If [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) is your [Favored Ability](../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), remember to double it for this check.*
## Damage
On a successful [Check](Check.md):
- Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../Items/Weapons.md) damage die and add your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).

On a failed [Check](Check.md):
- Deal damage equal to your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md), no die roll.

On a [Critical Failure](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md), you [Critical Miss](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md).
## Melee Range
Melee attacks have a range of 5â€™ (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.
## Improvised Weapons
Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) on a successful [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) against AC, and no damage on a failure.
