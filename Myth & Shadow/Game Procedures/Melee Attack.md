# Melee Attack

To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

- *If [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) is your [Favored Ability](../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), remember to add that to this [Check](Check.md).*

## Damage

On a successful [Check](Check.md):

- Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../Items/Weapons.md) damage die and add 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).

On a failed [Check](Check.md):

- You may use your remaining [Movement](Movement.md) to deal damage equal to 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).
	- This is known as a [Melee Bash](Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash).
	- No die roll is made, the damage is flat.
- Otherwise, the attack deals **no damage**.
	- *If the result was greater than or equal to 10, it glances harmlessly off their armor*
	- *If the result was less than 10, the attack is parried or evaded*

On a [Critical Failure](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md), you [Critical Miss](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md).

## Melee Range

Melee attacks have a range of 5' (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.

## Melee Bash

- When you fail a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md) roll, you can perform a quick bash against your foe.
	- You deal damage equal to 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md), no roll required.
		- You may use [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) if wielding a [Finesse](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Finesse%20Property.md) weapon.
- Using a melee bash costs you **all** your remaining [Movement](Movement.md) this [Turn](Turn.md).
	- You may perform a melee bash even if you have already moved this [Turn](Turn.md), you just cannot move after you perform a melee bash.

## Improvised Weapons

Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) on a successful [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) against [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), and no damage on a failure.
