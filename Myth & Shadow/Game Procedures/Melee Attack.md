# Melee Attack
To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). 
- *If [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) is your [Favored Ability](../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), remember to add that to this [Check](Check.md).*
## Damage
On a successful [Check](Check.md):
- Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../Items/Weapons.md) damage die and add 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).

On a failed [Check](Check.md):
- You may use your [Reaction](Reaction.md) to deal damage equal to 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) (no die roll).
	- This is known as a melee bash
- Otherwise, the attack deals **no damage**.
	- *If the result was greater than or equal to 10, it glances harmlessly off their armor*
	- *If the result was less than 10, the attack is parried or evaded*

On a [Critical Failure](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md), you [Critical Miss](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md).
## Melee Range
Melee attacks have a range of 5â€™ (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.
## Improvised Weapons
Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to 1 + [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) on a successful [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) against [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), and no damage on a failure.
