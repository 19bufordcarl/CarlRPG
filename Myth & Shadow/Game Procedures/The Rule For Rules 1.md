# The Rule for Rules

The more specific ruling should overrule a more general rule, unless it causes a paradox or especially problematic interaction. The GM's rulings are the most specific, as they are tailored to the situation and thus are final.

## General Math Rules

### Rounding

Unless otherwise specified, decimal numbers should always be rounded down (truncated).

- 4.5 = 4
- 4.1 = 4
- 4.9 = 4

### Halving

Whenever you halve a number, round down as well.

If multiple sources halve a number, the number is halved each of those times (halving stacks).
