# Critical Failure

A [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with a d20 roll of 1, called a natural 1, is a [Critical Failure](Critical%20Failure.md).

This is always a failure no matter what.

In certain cases, it results in some extra detrimental effect, like a [Critical Miss](Critical%20Miss.md).
