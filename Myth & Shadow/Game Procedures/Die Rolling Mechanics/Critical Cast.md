# Critical Cast

When making [A Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), if you rolled a [Critical Success](Critical%20Success.md), you can do a critical cast.

A critical cast allows you to double any numerical effect of that [Spell](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spells.md) for its [Duration](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Duration), or double the duration itself.
