# Critical Cast

When making [A Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), if you rolled a [Critical Success](Critical%20Success.md), you can do a critical cast.

A critical cast allows you to treat the spell as upcast by 1 [Spell Level](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Level.md) for free.
