# Reroll Tokens (Luck)

Reroll Tokens are way to represent that the PCs are the main characters of the story and they are inherently lucky.

## Gaining Reroll Tokens

***A PC may only have 1 reroll token at a time.***

Certain special abilities or magic may grant the PC a Reroll Token.

*See [Lucky](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Flavor/Human.md#Lucky) and [Luck](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/Luck.md).*

## Spending Reroll Tokens

A PC can spend a Reroll Token to reroll any die roll that *they* made. The new result must be used.

You **cannot** use these to reroll another player's die rolls, or the GM's die rolls, your rolls only.

Any unspent Reroll Tokens at the end of a session expire, they do not carry over.
