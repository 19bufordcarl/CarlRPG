# Reroll Tokens

Reroll Tokens are a way to represent that the PCs are the heroes of the story.

A PC can only have 1 reroll token at a time.

## Gaining Reroll Tokens

[Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md), [Praying](../../Magic/Deities.md#Praying), or other mythical events may grant the PC a Reroll Token.

## Spending Reroll Tokens

A PC can spend a Reroll Token to reroll any die roll that they made. The new result must be used.

Any unspent Reroll Tokens at the end of a session expire, they do not carry over.

*You **cannot** use them to reroll another player's die rolls or the GM's die rolls â€” your rolls only.*
