# Critical Miscast

When you do not have enough [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) for your [Magicka Point Cost](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Mythril.md#Magicka%20Point%20Cost) during [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md), you miscast the spell.

The spell backfires in some unexpected, usually bad, way. Roll on the [Miscast Table](../../Magic/Spells/Miscast%20Tables/Miscast%20Table.md).
