# Critical Miscast

When [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) is a [Critical Failure](Critical%20Failure.md), you miscast the spell.

The spell backfires in some unexpected, usually bad, way. Roll on the [Miscast Table](../../Magic/Spells/Miscast%20Tables/Miscast%20Table.md).
