# Exploding Dice

Exploding dice means that if you roll the max value possible on a given die, then you roll that die again and add the results together.

This process repeats until you do not roll the max value on the die.

*For example, you roll an 8 on your d8. You roll again; another 8. You roll again; a 5. Your total for this roll is 8 + 8 + 5 = 21.*
