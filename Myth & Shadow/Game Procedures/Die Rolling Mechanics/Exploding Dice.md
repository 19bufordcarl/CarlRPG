# Exploding Dice

Exploding dice means that if you roll the max value possible on a given die, then you roll that die again and add the results together. This process repeats until you do not roll the max value on the die.

*For example, I roll an 8 on my d8. I roll again and get another 8. I roll again and get a 5. My total for this roll is 8 + 8 + 5 = 21.*
