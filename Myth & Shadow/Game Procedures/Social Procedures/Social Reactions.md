# Social Reactions

In general, the expectation is that most behavior is handled by PCs roleplaying.

If the GM feels the NPCs reaction is debatable, they may ask the PC that was talking to them to make a [Speechcraft](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Speechcraft.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with their [Proficiency](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Skills.md#Proficiency) **tier** as the bonus. The GM interprets the result as an analog number, where a higher result correlates to a more favorable NPC reaction to the PC.

*There are no hard rules for what different results are. It is up to the GM's discretion how the NPC reacts based on the number rolled. If the situation is effectively binary, the GM may inform the PC of the [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) prior to them rolling.*
