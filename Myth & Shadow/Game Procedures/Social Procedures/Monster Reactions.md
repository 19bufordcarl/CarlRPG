# Monster Reactions

When the PCs encounter a monster from a random table, the GM rolls for its reaction.
*[Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) are always hostile*.

The GM may add [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) of the *Scout* to the 2d6 roll.
