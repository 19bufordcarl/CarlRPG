# Monster Reactions

When the PCs encounter a monster from a random table, the *Scout* makes a [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

The GM consults the following table to determine the monster's reaction.

|        d20 | Reaction |
| ---------: | :------- |
| 14 or less | Hostile  |
|      15-19 | Wary     |
|      20-24 | Curious  |
|        25+ | Cordial  |

*Random [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) are always hostile to living creatures*.
