# Monster Reactions

When the PCs encounter a monster from a random table, the *Scout* makes a [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) check.

The GM consults the following table to determine the monster's reaction.

|       d20 | Reaction                                                  |
| --------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9 or less | Hostile                                                   |
|     10-19 | Wary (reroll in 1 [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md)) |
|     20-24 | Curious                                                   |
|       25+ | Cordial                                                   |

*[Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) are always hostile to living creatures*.
