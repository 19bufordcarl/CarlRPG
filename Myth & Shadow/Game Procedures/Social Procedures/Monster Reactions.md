# Monster Reactions

When the PCs encounter a potentially non-hostile monster from a random table, the *Scout* may make a [Speechcraft](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Speechcraft.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with their [Proficiency](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Skills.md#Proficiency) **tier** as the bonus.

The GM consults the following table to determine the monster's reaction.

| d20 check | Reaction |
| --------: | :------- |
| 9 or less | Hostile  |
|     10-14 | Wary     |
|     15-19 | Curious  |
|       20+ | Cordial  |

*Random [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) are always hostile to living creatures*.
