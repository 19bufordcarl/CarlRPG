# Monster Reactions

When the PCs encounter a potentially non-hostile monster from a random table, the *Scout* may make a [Speechcraft](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Speechcraft.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) but with a d6 instead of a d20.

The GM consults the following table to determine the monster's reaction.

|        d6 | Reaction |
| --------: | :------- |
| 4 or less | Hostile  |
|       5-6 | Wary     |
|       7-8 | Curious  |
|        9+ | Cordial  |

*Random [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) are always hostile to living creatures*.
