# Monster Reactions

When encountering a likely hostile creature from a random table, usually when [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md) or during an [Overland Journey](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md), if the creature would not clearly be hostile, then the GM rolls for its reaction.
*Undead would clearly be hostile for example.*

The GM may add [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) of the relevant PC to the 2d6 roll.
