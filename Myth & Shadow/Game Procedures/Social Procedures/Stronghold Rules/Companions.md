# Companions

Companions follow their PC into great danger, even the [Shadowcurse](../../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).

## Number of Companions

Each PC can have only one companion at a time.

## Max Level

A companion's [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) must be less than their PCs [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) or [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md), whichever is lower.
*Minimum of 1*

## Finding Companions

A PC must be at least [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 3 to attract a companion. They follow the [New Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md) process to create this companion. Work with your GM to determine whether this companion is appropriate for the campaign as you would a PC.

## Leveling Up

At the end of each session, companions may [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).
*If they can with their current [Max Level](Companions.md#Max%20Level).*

## Logistics

The player of the PC this companion is following tracks this companions abilities and controls them in combat. Companions cannot have the [Dying](../../Conditions/Dying.md) condition since they are not PCs. Companions simply die upon reaching 0 HP.

If a PC dies, their companion becomes their new PC.

### Less Brutal Death

*Optional Rule*
In between this and next session, the companion [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) to whatever the PCs old level was.

*The Fates allow the PCs spirit to imbue their companion with their experience.*
