# Companions

Companions follow their PC into great danger, even the [Shadowcurse](../../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).

## Number of Followers

Each PC can have only one companion at a time.

## Max Level

A companion's [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) must be less than their PCs [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).

## Finding Followers

A PC must be at least [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 3 to attract a companion. They follow the [New Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md) process to create this companion. Work with your GM to determine whether this companion is appropriate for the campaign as you would a PC.

## Leveling Up

Whenever the companion's PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), if the companion's [Max Level](#Max%20Level) would increase, then the companion may also [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They can level up twice if the PCs [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) is

## Logistics

The player of the PC this companion is following tracks this companions abilities and controls them in combat. Companions cannot have the [Dying](../../Conditions/Dying.md) condition, they are not PCs, they simply die upon reaching 0 HP.

If a PC dies, their companion becomes their new PC.
