# Companions

*Optional Rule*
Companions follow the party into great danger, even the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Some campaigns may not allow PCs to attract companions.

## Number of Companions

Each PC can have only one companion at a time.

## Companions Level

A companion's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) must be less than their PCs [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).

At the end of a session, a companion may [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) if they are able.

## Finding Companions

A PC can only find a companion whose [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than both the PC's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). You make companions with the [New Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md) process.

*Work with your GM to determine whether a specific companion is appropriate.*

## Logistics and Death

The player of the PC this companion is following tracks this companions abilities and controls them in combat. Companions cannot have the [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) condition since they are not PCs. Companions simply die upon reaching 0 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).

If a PC dies, they may have their companion become their new PC.

### Less Brutal Death

*Optional Rule*
In between this and next session, the companion [Levels Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) to whatever the PCs old level was.

*The Fates allow the PCs spirit to imbue their companion with their experience.*
