# Companions

*Optional Rule*
Companions follow the party into great danger, even the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Companions are a great option for games with fewer players (1-3) to help bolster their effectiveness.

## Number of Companions

The *Party* can have only one companion.

## Companions Level

A companion's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) cannot exceed the PCs [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md).

At the end of a session, a companion may [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up) if they are able.

## Finding Companions

The PCs can only find companions when the GM allows it.

Generally this would be either at the start of the campaign or after a companion or PC perishes. You make companions with the [New Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md) process.

*If nobody can cast [Heal Wounds](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Heal%20Wounds.md), consider getting a companion who can*.

## Logistics and Death

Designate a player to track the companion's abilities and control them mechanically both in and out of combat. The GM roleplays the companion. Companions are treated as a pseudo-PC.

If a PC dies, they may choose to have the companion become their new PC.
