# Morale

Morale determines when monsters will attempt to flee or negotiate.

## Breaking Points

Breaking points are situations in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) that trigger a morale [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md). They are:

- A solo monster going below [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) HP.
- A group losing [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their members.
- A group losing their leader â€” [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) and [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) counts as losing.
- Anything else the GM deems could break morale.

## Monster Morale

When a breaking point occurs, the GM makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) for the monster or the leader if there is a group. On a failure, the *whole group's* morale is broken.

On a failed morale check, the monsters attempt to flee. If they deem fleeing impossible or unlikely then they attempt to negotiate for surrender or a bargain.
