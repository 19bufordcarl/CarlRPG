# Ranged Attack

To make a ranged attack, you make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). 

On a success, you roll damage die according to whatever [Weapon](../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) you used to make the attack, and add your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) to get the final damage.

The range of the weapon you use represents how far you can hit a target. You incur a -2 penalty to attack [Check](Check.md) per time you would need to add the range to reach the distance to the target. To a maximum of -20. After that attacks are out of range of that weapon.
## Range Attack Penalties
### Out of Range
Once you are beyond the [Range](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ranged%20Property.md) of a [Weapon](../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md), you have [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on [Attacks](Attack.md). 
*The maximum range is 10x the range of the weapon.*
### Threatened
Making a ranged attack [Check](Check.md) while [Threatened](../Conditions/Threatened.md) (in melee) imposes [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
## Improvised Ranged Weapons
Improvised ranged attacks like throwing a rock, or a [Glass Vial](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md), deal [Bludgeoning](../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) damage equal to your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) and have a range of 5'.
## Line of Sight and Cover Rules
- If a target is behind cover, the attack is made with a -10 penalty. (AKA add 10 to their AC).

- If the target is totally obstructed from the attacker, but the attacker knows their precise location (within a 5’ square), they can make an attack with the -10 penalty and [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) provided there exists a reasonable path for the projectile’s arc to the target.

- If the attacker does not know the precise location or there is no reasonable path for the projectile, then no attack can be made / the attack automatically misses.
## Ranged Penalty Table
*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
Replace the standard disadvantage on attacks with a much more detailed and "realistic" table. Functionally, these penalties can be treated instead as bonuses to the defending creatures [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). Ties use the lesser penalty.

| Distance to Target | Distance to Target | Distance to Target | Penalty |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| 30' or less        | 60’ or less        | 100’ or less       | 0       |
| 30'-60'            | 60’-120’           | 100’-200’          | -2      |
| 60'-90'            | 120’-180’          | 200’-300’          | -4      |
| 90’-120’           | 180’-240’          | 300’-400’          | -6      |
| 120’-150’          | 240’-300’          | 400’-500’          | -8      |
| 150’-180’          | 300’-360’          | 500’-600’          | -10     |
| 180’-210’          | 360’-420’          | 600’-700’          | -12     |
| 210’-240’          | 420’-480’          | 700’-800’          | -14     |
| 240’-270’          | 480’-540’          | 800’-900’          | -16     |
| 270’-300’          | 540’-600’          | 900’-1000’         | -18     |
| 300’-330’          | 600’-660’          | 1000’-1100’        | -20     |
