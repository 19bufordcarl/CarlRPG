# Ranged Attack
To make a ranged attack, you make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).
- *If [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) is your [Favored Ability](../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), remember to add that to this [Check](Check.md).*
## Damage
On a successful [Check](Check.md):
- Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../Items/Weapons.md) damage die and add [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

On a failed [Check](Check.md):
- The attack deals **no damage**.
	- *If the result was greater than or equal to 10, it glances harmlessly off their armor*
	- *If the result was less than 10, it does not hit the target at all*
### Threatened
Ranged attacks made against combatants that are [Threatening](../Conditions/Threatened.md) you (in melee) have [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
## Range Distance Penalties
Once you are beyond the [Range](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ranged%20Property.md) of a [Weapon](../Items/Weapons.md), its [Attacks](Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).

*The default maximum range is 10x the range of the weapon. You can only shoot what you can see, however, so that may effectively reduce your maximum range.*
## Improvised Ranged Weapons
Improvised ranged weapons, such as throwing a [Glass Vial](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md), deal [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md). You *may* use [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) instead of [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) for the attack and damage. These attacks have a range of 30'.

If the improvised weapon is a [Melee Weapon](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Melee%20Property.md) without the [Thrown Property](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Thrown%20Property.md), you may add the damage die for the weapon if you beat the target's [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by 10 or more.
## Line of Sight and Cover Rules
If the target is totally obstructed from the attacker (behind cover), but the attacker knows their precise location (within a 5’ square), they make their attack [Check](Check.md) with a -10 penalty (provided there exists a reasonable path for the projectile’s arc to the target).

If the attacker does not know the precise location or there is no reasonable path for the projectile, then no attack can be made (aka the attack automatically misses).
##### FAQ
*Partial obstructions provide no cover benefit; creatures are always trying to avoid projectiles.*

*Creatures can choose to ready an [Action](Action.md) to make the attack once a target is out of cover. This will use both an [Action](Action.md) and [Reaction](Reaction.md) that [Round](Round.md), however.*
