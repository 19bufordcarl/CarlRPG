# Ranged Attack

To make a ranged attack, you make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

- *If [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) is your [Favored Ability](../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), remember to add that to this [Check](Check.md).*

## Damage

On a successful [Check](Check.md):

- Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../Items/Weapons.md) damage die and add [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

On a failed [Check](Check.md):

- The attack deals **no damage**.
	- *If the result was greater than or equal to 10, it glances harmlessly off their armor*
	- *If the result was less than 10, it does not hit the target at all*

### Threatened

Ranged attacks made against combatants that are [Threatening](../Conditions/Threatened.md) you (in melee) have [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).

## Range Distance Penalties

Once you are beyond the [Range](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ranged%20Property.md) of a [Weapon](../Items/Weapons.md), its [Attacks](Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).

If you have positive [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md), the maximum range is 10x the stated range. Otherwise, it is 2x the stated range. You can only only attempt to shoot targets that you see or otherwise know the precise location thereof.

## Improvised Ranged Weapons

Improvised ranged weapons, such as throwing a heavy rock, deal [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md). You *may* use [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) instead of [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) for the attack and damage. These attacks have a range of 30'.

If the improvised weapon is a [Melee Weapon](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Melee%20Property.md) without the [Thrown Property](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Thrown%20Property.md), you may add the damage die for the weapon if you beat the target's [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by 10 or more.

## Line of Sight and Cover Rules

If the target is totally obstructed from the attacker (behind cover), but the attacker knows their precise location (within a 5' square), they make their attack [Check](Check.md) with a -10 penalty (provided there exists a reasonable path for the projectile's arc to the target).

If the attacker does not know the precise location or there is no reasonable path for the projectile, then no attack can be made (aka the attack automatically misses).

If there are significant barriers between the attacker and the target, but they are not totally obstructed, the GM may give the attacker [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md). The barriers should be *significant.*

- *Standing in tall grass is not significant.*
- *Being obscured by fog **and** standing in tall grass is significant.*

### FAQ

*The GM should let the PCs know when a creature is obscured / obstructed if they can or are asked.*

*Creatures can [Ready](Reaction.md#Ready) an [Action](Action.md) to make the attack once a target is out of cover.
