# Ranged Attack
To make a ranged attack, you make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). 
## Damage
On a success, roll the damage die of the [Weapon](../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) used to make the attack. Add half your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) (rounded down) to this die roll to get the total damage dealt.
## Range Attack Penalties
### Out of Range
Once you are beyond the [Range](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ranged%20Property.md) of a [Weapon](../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md), you have [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on [Attacks](Attack.md). 
*The default maximum range is 10x the range of the weapon. The referee should overrule this if there are environmental circumstances i.e. if you are on a big hill you can shoot farther.*
### Threatened
Making a ranged attack [Check](Check.md) while [Threatened](../Conditions/Threatened.md) (in melee) provokes [Opportunity Attacks](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks). 
## Improvised Ranged Weapons
Improvised ranged attacks like throwing a rock, or a [Glass Vial](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md), deal 1 [Mundane Damage](../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) have a range of 30'.
## Line of Sight and Cover Rules
If a target is behind cover, the attack is made with a -10 penalty. (AKA add 10 to their AC).

If the target is totally obstructed from the attacker, but the attacker knows their precise location (within a 5’ square), they can make an attack with the -10 penalty and [Disadvantage](Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) provided there exists a reasonable path for the projectile’s arc to the target.

If the attacker does not know the precise location or there is no reasonable path for the projectile, then no attack can be made / the attack automatically misses.

*Players, you can choose to ready an [Action](Action.md) to make an attack once a target is out of cover. This will use both your [Action](Action.md) and [Reaction](Reaction.md) that [Round](Round.md), however.*
## Ranged Penalty Table
*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
Replace the standard disadvantage on attacks with a much more detailed and "realistic" table. Functionally, these penalties can be treated instead as bonuses to the defending creatures [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). Ties use the lesser penalty.

| Distance to Target | Distance to Target | Distance to Target | Penalty |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| 30' or less        | 60’ or less        | 100’ or less       | 0       |
| 30'-60'            | 60’-120’           | 100’-200’          | -2      |
| 60'-90'            | 120’-180’          | 200’-300’          | -4      |
| 90’-120’           | 180’-240’          | 300’-400’          | -6      |
| 120’-150’          | 240’-300’          | 400’-500’          | -8      |
| 150’-180’          | 300’-360’          | 500’-600’          | -10     |
| 180’-210’          | 360’-420’          | 600’-700’          | -12     |
| 210’-240’          | 420’-480’          | 700’-800’          | -14     |
| 240’-270’          | 480’-540’          | 800’-900’          | -16     |
| 270’-300’          | 540’-600’          | 900’-1000’         | -18     |
| 300’-330’          | 600’-660’          | 1000’-1100’        | -20     |
