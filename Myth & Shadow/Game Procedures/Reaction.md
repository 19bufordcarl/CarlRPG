# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during combat when no [Action](Action.md) is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per [Round](Round.md).
*Imagine you have a reaction point. It refreshes on your turn, use it or lose it.*

Common Reactions Include:
- Ready an [Action](Action.md):
	- Allows you to turn any [Action](Action.md) into a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).
	- *This uses an action, so it's not action economy efficient*
- Melee Bash:
	- When you miss a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md), you can deal damage equal to your damage modifier. 
- [Shield Block](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20X%20Property.md#Shield%20Block%20X): 
	- Raises your [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) according to the shield you have equipped.
- Avoid one [Opportunity Attack](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks)

Unless you ready an action, only specified abilities and spells can be used as a reaction.
