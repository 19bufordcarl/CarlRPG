# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during [Combat](Combat.md) when no [Action](Action.md) is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per [Round](Round.md).
- *Imagine you have a reaction point. It refreshes on your turn, use it or lose it.*

Unless you [Ready](Reaction.md#Ready) an [Action](Action.md), only specified abilities can be used as a reaction.

The default reactions are:
## Ready
- Available only if you used your [Action](Action.md) to ready it as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).
- *Ex. When they get out from behind cover I want to shoot them with my arrow.*
## Melee Bash
- When you miss a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md), you can deal damage equal to your damage modifier.
- You cannot use this reaction if you rolled a [Critical Miss](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md).
## [Shield Block](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20X%20Property.md#Shield%20Block%20X)
- Raises your [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) according to the shield you have equipped for one [Attack](Attack.md).
## Disengage
- Make one [Opportunity Attack](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks) made against you automatically miss.
## [Opportunity Attack](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks)
- When a creature leaves your melee range, you can make a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md) against them.
