# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during [Combat](Combat.md) when no [Action](Action.md) is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per [Round](Round.md). In order to take a reaction, you **must** ready an [Action](Action.md) on your [Turn](Turn.md).

## Ready

- On your turn, you may specify an [Action](Action.md) you wish to take when something happens prior to your next turn. You gain this [Action](Action.md) as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).
	- *Ex. When the ghoul gets out from behind cover, I want to shoot them with my arrow.*
- Readying an action can only be done within [Combat](Combat.md). You must setup circumstances to gain [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) if you want the benefits of readying an action prior to combat.
