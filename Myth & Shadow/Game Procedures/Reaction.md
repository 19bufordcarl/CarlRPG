# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during combat when no [Action](Action.md) is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per [Round](Round.md).
*Imagine you have a reaction point. It refreshes on your turn, use it or lose it.*

Common Reactions Include:
- Readying an [Action](Action.md) (allows you to turn any [Action](Action.md) into a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md))
	- *This itself costs an action, so it's not action economy efficient*
- [Shield Block](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20Property.md#Shield%20Block)
- Avoid one [Opportunity Attack](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks)

Unless you ready an action, only specified abilities and spells can be used as a reaction.
