# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during [Combat](Combat.md) when no [Action](Action.md) is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per [Round](Round.md). In order to take a reaction, you **must** ready an [Action](Action.md) on your [Turn](Turn.md).

## Ready

- On your turn, you may specify an [Action](Action.md) you wish to take when something happens prior to your next turn. You gain this [Action](Action.md) as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).
	- *Ex. When the ghoul gets out from behind cover, I want to shoot them with my arrow.*

### Passive Readying
*Optional Rule*

- By default, readying an action can only be done with in [Combat](Combat.md). If a situation truly calls for an action to be readied outside of combat, it costs a PC 1 [FP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) for every [Delving Action](Action.md#Delving%20Action) they have the action readied. If this reduces their [FP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) to 0, they gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
