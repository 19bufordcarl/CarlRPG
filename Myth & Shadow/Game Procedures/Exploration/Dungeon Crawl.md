# Dungeon Crawl

A dungeon crawl is a specific type of [Delving](Delving.md), used to resolve dungeon exploration.

## Procedure

The procedure for a dungeon crawl is as follows.

### Entering the Dungeon

- [ ] The PCs determine their [Marching Order](Delving.md#Marching%20Order)
- [ ] The GM determines the [Explorable Area](Delving.md#Explorable%20Area), usually with a map

### Entering a Room or Zone

- [ ] The [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) ends and the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](Delving.md#Dungeon%20Turn).

### Entering a Hex

- [ ] Determine if the [Navigator](Overland%20Journeys.md#Navigator) got lost
- [ ] Determine if there is an encounter based on [Danger Level](Overland%20Journeys.md#Danger%20Level)
	- [ ] The [Scout](Overland%20Journeys.md#Scout) is on the lookout for encounters
- [ ] Determine if there are any special feature in this hex
	- [ ] If there are, the GM should give out relevant secrets or clues
- [ ] The party can choose to spend a hex movement to perform other actions
	- [ ] Search the current hex, for instance

### End of a Day

- [ ] The [Quartermaster](Overland%20Journeys.md#Quartermaster) tracks any expended resources
	- [ ] [Rations](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/1%20Coin/Ration.md), [Torches](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/1%20Coin/Torch.md), etc.
