# Dungeon Crawl

A dungeon crawl is a specific type of [Delving](Delving.md), used to resolve dungeon exploration.

## Procedure

The procedure for a dungeon crawl is as follows.

### Entering the Dungeon

- [ ] The PCs determine their [Marching Order](Delving.md#Marching%20Order)
- [ ] The GM determines the [Explorable Area](Delving.md#Explorable%20Area), usually with a map

### Entering a Room or Zone

- [ ] The [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) ends and the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](Delving.md#Dungeon%20Turn).
- [ ] If the GM rolled an encounter on the [Delving Hazard Die](Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die), the generate a [Random Encounter](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Random%20Encounters.md).
- [ ] Otherwise they describe the room the PCs entered as they [Search](Delving.md#Search) it.
- [ ] The PCs describe how the interact with anything in the room.
- [ ] When something causes [Ending a Delve Round](Delving.md#Ending%20a%20Delve%20Round), go back to the start of this section.
- [ ] Repeat until the PCs leave or clear the dungeon.
