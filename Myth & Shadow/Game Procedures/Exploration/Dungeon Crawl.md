# Dungeon Crawl

A dungeon crawl is a specific type of [Delving](Delving.md), used to resolve dungeon exploration.

## Procedure

The procedure for a dungeon crawl is as follows.

### Entering the Dungeon

- [ ] The PCs determine their [Marching Order](Delving.md#Marching%20Order).
- [ ] The PCs determine who is using a [Torch](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Torch%20Kit.md#Torch), [Lantern](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/25%20Coins/Lantern%20Kit.md#Lantern), or [Light](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Light.md).
- [ ] The GM determines the [Explorable Area](Delving.md#Explorable%20Area), usually with a map.

### Entering a New Room or Zone

- [ ] The GM rolls and updates the [Danger Clock](Danger%20Clock.md).
- [ ] Otherwise they describe the room the PCs entered as they [Search](Delving.md#Search) it.
- [ ] The PCs describe how they interact with anything in the room.
- [ ] The GM reveals any relevant secrets or clues for the situation.
- [ ] Repeat until the PCs leave or clear the dungeon.

Whenever the PCs take a [Break](../Core%20Procedures/Break.md), the GM rolls and updates the [Danger Clock](Danger%20Clock.md).
