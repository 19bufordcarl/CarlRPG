# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, like the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), but not currently engaged in combat (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered [Delving]().

While [Delving](), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour.

## Tracking Turns

### Real Time Turn

*(Default Rule)*
The GM uses a real timer (stopwatch) set for 6 minutes which tracks a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). The GM should be descriptive but concise when describing the environment. This is a hazardous environment and the time pressure mechanic reinforces that. While in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), the timer stops.

If the players wish to do something that will take more time, the GM simply states how many [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) the [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) will take. If the players wish to proceed with this action, the GM then takes the appropriate number of [Dungeon Turns](#Dungeon%20Turn).

#### Dungeon Turn

The GM takes their turn, also called the dungeon turn. This happens at the end of each [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). During it, the GM makes the appropriate number of [Delving Hazard Die](#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) rolls, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.

### Party Turn

*(Optional Rule)*
If you are unable or unwilling to use a real timer, you can instead use the *Party Turn* rules.

When [Delving](), time is precious. The PCs should act together when delving. One PC is designated as the *caller* by the group when [Delving](). The PCs talk amongst themselves to decide what [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) the party will take this [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). Once they reach a decision, the caller relays this decision to the GM. The GM describes what happens and takes the [Dungeon Turn](#Dungeon%20Turn).

This represent the passing of roughly 6 minutes in game time.

## Delving Hazard Die

According to the danger level, roll the delving hazard die at the end of a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). On a result of 1, there is an encounter.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die Roll |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Normal       | d20             |
| Risky        | d12             |
| Deadly       | d6              |

### Encounter Distance and Reaction

The encounter monsters are placed at a random direction at the edge of the PCs vision. By default, a d12 with the result interpreted as the clockwise direction determines the direction of their placement. The [Monster Reactions](../Social%20Procedures/Monster%20Reactions.md) roll should be used if the reaction is unclear. See Creature .

## Primary Delve Actions

### Recover

One primary delve action is to recover. When a PC spends a round recovering, they regain [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). You can do this multiple [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) in a row.

You also recover any reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed / lost.

### Searching

One primary delve action is to search. Searching reveals any hidden features. These are things that are not immediately obvious, but would reasonably be found by a group of people taking roughly 5 minutes to look around carefully.

#### Hidden Features

A PC can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to search a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a loose brick, a cracked tile, etc.) If there is only [Candle](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Candle.md) light, this takes 2 rounds.

#### Secret Features

Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have clues, but can only be found through the players describing the PC's actions. The GM may have the PCs roll an investigation [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine what clue they get, but they should always get a clue.

### Delve Movement

Each PC gets delve movement in addition to their delve action when playing in [Party Turns](#Party%20Turn) while delving. If playing in [Real Time Turns](#Real%20Time%20Turn), then the GM should only use this when the PCs wish to move back through areas they have already described. The GM will not be describing the rooms again, and so this will use much less real time than it ought to.

When the move action is taken, the GM describes all the immediately obvious things about the environment they are in after moving, from which the players will choose how to interact with any relevant creatures or features of the environment.

There are 3 movement speeds when delving.

#### Delve Speed (Default)

The PCs normal [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md). You can spend a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) to [Dash](../Combat/Movement.md#Dash), doubling your [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md), and still retain these benefits.

#### Walk

1,000 feet (200 squares at 5 feet, 100 squares at 10 feet) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). At walking speed, PCs will be [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md) by all encounters and spring all traps. This takes a PC's [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action).

#### Run

5,000 feet (1000 squares at 5 feet, 500 squares at 10 feet) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). At running speed PCs will be [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md) by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. PCs can run for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) before becoming [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md). Candles go out when running. This takes a PC's [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action).
