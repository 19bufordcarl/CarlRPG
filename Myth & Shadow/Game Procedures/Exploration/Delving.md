# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, like the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), but not currently engaged in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered [Delving]().

While [Delving](), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour.

Whenever an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) is mentioned on this page, it is referring to a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action). Likewise, a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) refers to a [Delve Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Delve%20Turn), and a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round).

## Marching Order

When the Party starts [Delving](Delving.md), they should determine a marching order. Whoever is in front is the *Scout*. This will determine who encounters dangers like traps and monsters first.

## Tracking Delve Turns

### Party Turn

When [Delving](Delving.md), the GM divides the explorable area into zones. Each zone should be roughly the size the PCs can cover with their [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) (~30 feet). In a dungeon, each room is usually its own zone. Particularly large rooms may contain multiple zones.

Each PC gets a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), going in *Marching Order*. A PC can move anywhere in the current zone or to any adjacent zone, and perform one [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md). This action may be used to move again. Once each PC has taken their turn, the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](#Dungeon%20Turn) and then the [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends.

*Generally speaking, a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) should take 5-10 minutes of real time. It represents the passing of roughly 6 minutes in game time. The GM may use a 6 minute timer to track turns instead of Marching Order if everyone thinks it would increase the tension and fun at the table.*

### Dungeon Turn

The Dungeon Turn is effectively the GM's turn. It happens at the end of each [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

The GM makes the [Delving Hazard Die](#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) roll, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.

#### Delving Hazard Die

According to the danger level, the GM rolls the delving hazard die at the end of a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). On a result of 1, there is an encounter.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Normal       | d20        |
| Risky        | d12        |
| Deadly       | d6         |

*GMs, see [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Random%20Encounters.md).*

## Delve Actions

### Recover

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Recover*. They regain [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). They also recover any nearby reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed or lost.

PCs can recover multiple rounds in a row.

### Search

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Search* their current zone. The GM informs them of one hidden feature in the zone, or informs them if there are no hidden features remaining in the zone.

Hidden features are not obvious, but would reasonably be found by taking roughly 5 minutes to look around carefully. A PC may need to spend subsequent actions to search further details.
*A loose brick, a cracked tile, a suspicious ankle height wire, etc.*

#### Secret Features

Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, and the like are NOT outright revealed by a [Search](Delving.md#Search). The GM should give clues to these features, and the PCs can only find these by following the clues.

The GM may have the PCs roll an investigation [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine what clue they get if they prepared many clues, there should always be at least one clue.

### Move

Each PC gets to move in addition to their [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) on their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

There are 2 movement speeds the Party can choose from while [Delving](Delving.md). Delve and Flee.

#### Delve

The PCs normal [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). This allows them to move to an adjacent zone.

At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md).

A PC can spend their [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to move a second time in a single [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

#### Flee

The *Party* can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Flee* if all players agree. When the party flees, they successfully retreat from the area, carrying any fallen PCs with them. Each PC loses one item chosen at random that is left behind in the dangerous area. The party also suffers a narrative loss.

*Example narrative loss: If the party was trying to stop a ritual, the ritual succeeds.*

## Real Timer

*Optional*
All effects with a duration of **1 hour** are tracked in real time while delving.
