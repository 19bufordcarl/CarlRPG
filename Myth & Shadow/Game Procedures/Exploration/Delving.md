# Delving

While in an especially hostile environment but not currently engaged in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) — *like a [Dungeon Crawl](Dungeon%20Crawl.md)* — the PCs are considered *Delving*.

Whenever an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) is mentioned on this page, it is referring to a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action). Likewise, a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) refers to a [Delve Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Delve%20Turn), and a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round).

## Marching Order

When the PCs start [Delving](Delving.md), they should determine a marching order. Whoever is in front is the *Scout*. This determines who encounters dangers like traps and monsters first.

## Explorable Area

While [Delving](Delving.md), the GM divides the explorable area into [Zones](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md). In a dungeon, each room or hallway is usually its own zone. Particularly large rooms may contain multiple zones.

## Ending a Delve Round

When a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends, the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](#Dungeon%20Turn) and then a new round starts.

A [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends whenever:

1. A PC enters a new zone.
2. The PCs spend time to [Recover](Delving.md#Recover).
3. The PCs take time to do something else for roughly 6 minutes.

### Dungeon Turn

During the dungeon turn, the GM makes the [Delving Hazard Die](#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) roll, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.

### Delving Hazard Die

The GM rolls the delving hazard die at the end of a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). On a result of 1, there is an encounter. The GM determines the danger level of the explorable area.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Normal       | d20        |
| Risky        | d12        |
| Deadly       | d6         |

*GMs, see [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Encounters/Random%20Encounters.md).*

## Delving Actions

The main [Delving Actions](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) are [Recover](Delving.md#Recover) and [Move](Delving.md#Move).

The PCs may take [Delving Actions](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) all together.

### Recover

PCs can use a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) to *Recover*.

When a PC *Recovers*, they regain 1d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md).

### Move

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Move* to a new [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md). A PC can move to anywhere in their current zone once per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) without using an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

While moving at delving speed, PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps.

This means they automatically detect traps, map their environment, [Search](Delving.md#Search) for hidden features, and avoid being [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md), provided they are not in [Darkness](../Hazards/Darkness.md).

#### Search

While moving at delving speed, A PC may inquire about features of the current zone. The GM should describe any hidden features from the inquiry, but not any secret features. A PC must interact with the hidden features more directly to learn their secrets.

#### Example Features

**Hidden Features**: A loose brick, a cracked tile, or a bust with a seam around its neck.

**Secret Features**: The brick activates a trap, the tile covers a rusted hatch, the bust's head can be rotated to magically open a locked door.

### Flee

The *Party* can *Flee* an area only if all players agree. If they flee, they successfully retreat from the area, carrying any fallen PCs with them. Each PC loses one piece of [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md) chosen at random. It is left where they currently stand. There may be an additional narrative loss if appropriate.

*Example narrative loss: If the party was trying to stop a ritual, the ritual succeeds.*

## Tips

*The party should usually move as a group. They may split up, but this will cause them to roll many more random encounters, and so it is often not a good idea.*
