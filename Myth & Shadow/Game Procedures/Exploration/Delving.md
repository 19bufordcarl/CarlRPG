# Delving

While in an especially hostile environment but not currently engaged in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) — *like a dungeon* — the PCs are considered [Delving]().

While [Delving](), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour.

Whenever an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) is mentioned on this page, it is referring to a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action). Likewise, a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) refers to a [Delve Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Delve%20Turn), and a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round).

## Marching Order

When the PCs start [Delving](Delving.md), they should determine a marching order. Whoever is in front is the *Scout*. This determines who encounters dangers like traps and monsters first.

## Explorable Area

While [Delving](Delving.md), the GM divides the explorable area into zones. Each zone should be roughly the size the PCs can cover with their [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) (~30 feet). In a dungeon, each room is usually its own zone. Particularly large rooms may contain multiple zones.

## Ending a Delve Round

When a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends, the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](#Dungeon%20Turn) and then a new round starts.

A [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends whenever:

1. A PC enters a new zone.
2. The PCs spend time to [Recover](Delving.md#Recover).

### Dungeon Turn

The Dungeon Turn is effectively the GM's turn. It happens at the end of each [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

The GM makes the [Delving Hazard Die](#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) roll, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.

#### Delving Hazard Die

According to the danger level of the explorable area, the GM rolls the delving hazard die at the end of a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). On a result of 1, there is an encounter.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Normal       | d20        |
| Risky        | d12        |
| Deadly       | d6         |

*GMs, see [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Random%20Encounters.md).*

## Delve Actions

The main actions are [Recover](Delving.md#Recover), [Search](Delving.md#Search), and [Move](Delving.md#Move).

### Recover

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Recover*. They regain [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). They also recover any nearby reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed or lost.

PCs can recover multiple rounds in a row.

### Search

### Move

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to move to a new zone. The PCs can move to anywhere in their current zone once per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) and still use their [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) for something else.

There are 2 movement speeds the PCs can choose from while [Delving](Delving.md). Delve and Flee.

#### Delve

The PCs normal [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). This allows them to move to an adjacent zone.

At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md).

A PC can spend their [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to move a second time in a single [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

##### Search

While delving, PCs may inquire about features of the explorable area. The GM should describe any hidden features about the PCs inquiry, but the PCs must figure out secret features on their own.

**Hidden Features**: A loose brick, a cracked tile, a suspicious ankle height wire, etc.*

###### Secret Features

Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, and the like are NOT outright revealed by a [Search](Delving.md#Search). The GM should give clues to these features, and the PCs can only find these by following the clues.

The GM may have the PCs roll an investigation [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine what clue they get if they prepared many clues, there should always be at least one clue.

#### Flee

The *Party* can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Flee* if all players agree. If they flee, they successfully retreat from the area, carrying any fallen PCs with them. Each PC loses one item chosen at random that is left behind in the dangerous area. There may be an additional narrative loss depending on the story.

*Example narrative loss: If the party was trying to stop a ritual, the ritual succeeds.*

## Real Timer

*Optional*
All effects with a duration of **1 hour** are tracked in real time while delving.

## Tips

*The party should move as a group. They may split up, but this will cause them to roll many more random encounters.*

*On average, a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) should take ~5 minutes of real time. Rounds with combat may be longer, while other rounds may be shorter, but it should roughly average out.*
