# Delving

While in an especially hostile environment but not currently engaged in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) — *like a [Dungeon Crawl](Dungeon%20Crawl.md)* — the PCs are considered *Delving*.

## Marching Order

When the PCs start [Delving](Delving.md), they should determine a marching order. Whoever is in front is the *Scout*. This determines who encounters dangers like traps and monsters first.

## Explorable Area

While [Delving](Delving.md), the GM divides the explorable area into [Zones](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md). In a dungeon, each room or hallway is usually its own zone. Particularly large rooms may contain multiple zones.

*The GM often uses a dungeon map as a reference for the area.

## Encounters

Whenever the PCs enter a new [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) or take a [Break](../Core%20Procedures/Break.md), the GM rolls for the [Danger Clock](Danger%20Clock.md).

## Move

While delving, PCs are assumed to be spending most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps.

This means they automatically detect traps, map their environment, [Search](Delving.md#Search) for hidden features, and avoid being [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md), provided they are not in [Darkness](../Hazards/Darkness.md).

### Search

While delving, A PC may inquire about features of the current zone. The GM should describe any hidden features in the current zone, but not any secret features. A PC must interact with the hidden features more directly to learn their secrets.

Especially difficult searches may require a [Break](../Core%20Procedures/Break.md) to complete.

### Example Features

**Hidden Features**: A loose brick, a cracked tile, or a bust with a seam around its neck.

**Secret Features**: The brick activates a trap, the tile covers a rusted hatch, the bust's head can be rotated to magically open a locked door.

## Flee

The *Party* can *Flee* an area only if all players agree. If they flee, they successfully retreat from the area, carrying any fallen PCs with them.

Each PC loses one piece of [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md) chosen at random. It is left where they currently stand.

There may be an additional narrative loss if applicable.

*Example narrative loss: If the party was trying to stop a ritual, the ritual succeeds.*
