# Delving

While in an especially hostile environment but not currently engaged in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) — *like a dungeon* — the PCs are considered *Delving*. While *Delving*, time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour.

Whenever an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) is mentioned on this page, it is referring to a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action). Likewise, a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) refers to a [Delve Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Delve%20Turn), and a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round).

## Marching Order

When the PCs start [Delving](Delving.md), they should determine a marching order. Whoever is in front is the *Scout*. This determines who encounters dangers like traps and monsters first.

## Explorable Area

While [Delving](Delving.md), the GM divides the explorable area into zones. Each zone should be roughly the size the PCs can cover with their [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) — about 30 feet. In a dungeon, each room is usually its own zone. Particularly large rooms may contain multiple zones.

## Ending a Delve Round

When a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends, the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](#Dungeon%20Turn) and then a new round starts.

A [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends whenever:

1. A PC enters a new zone.
2. The PCs spend time to [Recover](Delving.md#Recover).
3. The PCs take time to do something else for roughly 6 minutes.

### Dungeon Turn

During the dungeon turn, the GM makes the [Delving Hazard Die](#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) roll, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.

#### Delving Hazard Die

The GM rolls the delving hazard die at the end of a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). On a result of 1, there is an encounter. The GM determines the danger level of the explorable area.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Normal       | d20        |
| Risky        | d12        |
| Deadly       | d6         |

*GMs, see [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Random%20Encounters.md).*

## Delve Actions

The main [Actions](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) are [Recover](Delving.md#Recover) and [Move](Delving.md#Move).

### Recover

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Recover*. They regain [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). They also recover any nearby reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed or lost. The PCs may choose to *Recover* all together.

PCs can recover multiple rounds in a row.

### Move

PCs can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to *Move* to a new zone. A PC can move to anywhere in their current zone once per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) without using an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md). The PCs may choose to *Move* all together.

While moving at delving speed, PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. They automatically detect traps, map their environment, [Search](Delving.md#Search) for hidden features, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md) — unless they are in [Darkness](../Hazards/Darkness.md).

#### Search

While moving at delving speed, A PC may inquire about features of the current zone. The GM should describe any hidden features from the PC's inquiry, but they do not automatically figure out secrets. A PC must interact with the features to learn their secrets.

**Hidden Features**: A loose brick, a cracked tile, or a bust with a seam around its neck.

**Secret Features**: The brick activates a trap, the tile covers a secret hatch, the bust's head can be rotated to magically open a locked door.

### Flee

The *Party* can *Flee* an area only if all players agree. If they flee, they successfully retreat from the area, carrying any fallen PCs with them. Each PC loses one item chosen at random. It is left where they currently stand. There may be an additional narrative loss if appropriate.

*Example narrative loss: If the party was trying to stop a ritual, the ritual succeeds.*

## Real Timer

*Optional*
Light sources with a duration in **hours** are tracked in real time while delving.

## Tips

*The party should move as a group. They may split up, but this will cause them to roll many more random encounters.*

*On average, a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) should take ~5 minutes of real time. Rounds with combat may be longer, while other rounds may be shorter, but it should roughly average out.*
