# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, like the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), but not currently engaged in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) (i.e. a dungeon) the party is considered [Delving]().

While [Delving](), time is divided into 6-minute segments called [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). There are 10 delve rounds per hour. All effects with a duration of **1 hour** are tracked in real time while delving.

## Tracking Delve Turns

### Party Turn

When [Delving](Delving.md), the GM divides the area being explored into zones. Each zone should be roughly the size the PCs can cover with their [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md). In a dungeon, each room is usually it's own zone. Particularly large rooms may have multiple sub-zones.

Each PC gets a [Delve Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Delve%20Turn), starting to the left of the GM. A PC can move to any adjacent zone, and perform one [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action). They can use this action to move again. Once each PC has taken their turn, the GM takes the [Dungeon Turn](#Dungeon%20Turn) and the [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) ends.

Generally speaking, a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) should take 5-10 minutes of real time. It represents the passing of roughly 6 minutes in game time. The GM may enforce a timer if they think it would increase the tension and fun at the table.

### Dungeon Turn

The Dungeon Turn is effectively the GM's turn. It happens at the end of each [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). During it, the GM makes the [Delving Hazard Die](#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) roll, updates any relevant parts of the environment, and adjusts any ongoing timers.

### Delving Hazard Die

According to the danger level, roll the delving hazard die at the end of a [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). On a result of 1, there is an *Encounter*.

| Danger Level | Hazard Die Roll |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Normal       | d20             |
| Risky        | d12             |
| Deadly       | d6              |

### Encounter Distance and Reaction

The encounter monsters are placed at a random direction at the edge of the PCs vision. By default, a d12 determines their "[O'clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_position)". The [Monster Reactions](../Social%20Procedures/Monster%20Reactions.md) roll should be used unless the monster is an [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md), or clearly hostile.

## Primary Delve Actions

### Recover

One primary delve action is to recover. When a PC spends a round recovering, they regain [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). You can do this multiple [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) in a row.

You also recover any reusable resources, such as [Ammo](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), that were not destroyed / lost.

### Searching

One primary delve action is to search. Searching reveals any hidden features. These are things that are not immediately obvious, but would reasonably be found by a group of people taking roughly 5 minutes to look around carefully.

#### Hidden Features

A PC can use an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to search a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a loose brick, a cracked tile, etc.) If there is only [Candle](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Candle.md) light, this takes 2 rounds.

#### Secret Features

Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have clues, but can only be found through the players describing the PC's actions. The GM may have the PCs roll an investigation [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine what clue they get, but they should always get a clue.

### Delve Movement

Each PC gets delve movement in addition to their delve action when playing in [Party Turns](#Party%20Turn) while delving. If playing in [Real Time Turns](#Real%20Time%20Turn), then the GM should only use this when the PCs wish to move back through areas they have already described. The GM will not be describing the rooms again, and so this will use much less real time than it ought to.

When the move action is taken, the GM describes all the immediately obvious things about the environment they are in after moving, from which the players will choose how to interact with any relevant creatures or features of the environment.

There are 3 movement speeds when delving.

#### Delve Speed (Default)

The PCs normal [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). At this speed PCs spend most of their time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows them to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) in [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md). You can spend a [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) to [Dash](../Combat/Movement.md#Dash), doubling your [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md), and still retain these benefits.

#### Walk

1,000 feet (200 squares at 5 feet, 100 squares at 10 feet) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). At walking speed, PCs will be [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md) by all encounters and spring all traps. This takes a PC's [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action).

#### Run

5,000 feet (1000 squares at 5 feet, 500 squares at 10 feet) per [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). At running speed PCs will be [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md) by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. PCs can run for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) before becoming [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md). Candles go out when running. This takes a PC's [Delving Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action).
