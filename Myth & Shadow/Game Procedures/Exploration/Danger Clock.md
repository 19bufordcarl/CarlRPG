# Danger Clock

The *Danger Clock* is a countdown tracked by the GM to represent the passing of time in a dangerous area where the party might encounter, well, dangers.

The clock starts at 0. Whenever a procedures instructs the GM to roll the [Danger Die](Danger%20Clock.md#Danger%20Die), they add the result from the clock.

## Encounter

**When the clock reaches 20, an encounter occurs, and afterwards the clock resets to 0.**

When the clock becomes exactly 19, the party finds a clue about the next encounter.

*GMs may use [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Encounters/Random%20Encounters.md)*.

## Danger Die

The more dangerous an area is, the larger the die gets.

| Danger Level | Danger Die |
| ------------ | ---------: |
| Normal       |         d6 |
| Risky        |        d12 |
| Deadly       |        d20 |
