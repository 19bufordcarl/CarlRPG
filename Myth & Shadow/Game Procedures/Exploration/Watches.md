# Watches

A watch is a period of time roughly three hours long.

Major [Overland Journey](Overland%20Journeys.md) actions (travel, forage, etc.) take a watch to complete.

A PC can spend at most 4 watches per day hex-crawling.

For each additional watch spend hex-crawling, they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check or become [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md).
