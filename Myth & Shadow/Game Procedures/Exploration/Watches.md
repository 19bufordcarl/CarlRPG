# Watches

A watch is a period of time roughly three hours long.

A PC can spend at most 4 watches per day [Hex Crawling](Hex%20Crawl.md). It takes 1 watch to set up camp, and 3 watches to [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

For each additional watch spent hex crawling, they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check or become [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md).
