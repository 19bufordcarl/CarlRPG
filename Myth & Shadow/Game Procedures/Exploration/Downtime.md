# Downtime

Downtime is time spent by PCs not adventuring. They may be traveling on a ship, building a homebase, researching, crafting, or otherwise honing their skills.

The GM decides how long downtime will be as determined by the pacing of the campaign. For more episodic games, 1-6 months of downtime provides ample spacing for the PCs to have their own lives separate from adventuring. For campaigns with more urgency, downtime might only be a day or a week.

Some activities can only be done over a period of downtime.
