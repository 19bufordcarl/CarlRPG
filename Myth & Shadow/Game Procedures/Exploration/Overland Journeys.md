# Overland Journeys

## Define the Journey

Before journeying to a destination, the PCs and GM should determine the following:

- Path (Determine the mode of [Travel](Overland%20Journeys.md#Travel), [Terrain](Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain), and [Danger Die](Danger%20Clock.md#Danger%20Die))
- [Roles](Overland%20Journeys.md#Roles) (Each PC should choose a role to serve on the journey)

If the party is traveling in a safe area, the journey can be abstracted into the total time and resources it will take to reach the destination, which are then consumed.

Otherwise, it is a [Hex Crawl](Hex%20Crawl.md).

## Travel

If the PCs travel further than the chart allows, they become [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) and lose all [Reroll Tokens](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md).

| Mode     | Hexes per Day | Speed |
| -------- | ------------: | ----: |
| Walk     |             4 | ~2mph |
| Mount    |             6 | ~3mph |
| Nautical |             8 | ~4mph |
| Special  |            10 | ~5mph |

*This assumes that a hex is ~6 miles wide, and the PCs travel ~12 hours per day*

## Terrain

A hex that is difficult terrain counts as two hexes to travel across. Some hexes are impassable. The GM determines whether a hex is difficult terrain or impassable.

## Encounters

Whenever the party:

1. Enters a new hex.
2. Takes time to thoroughly search a hex.
3. Takes a [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

The GM rolls for the [Danger Clock](Danger%20Clock.md). When the clock reaches 0, an encounter happens.

## Roles

The following roles determine what each party member is doing during the journey.

Each role should be filled if able. Multiple PCs can do the same role; they roll separately.

### Navigator

The *Navigator* is in charge of making sure the party stays on path towards their destination using maps and landmarks. If the terrain could be confusing, the GM makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) for the Navigator in secret. On a failure, the party moves to a random adjacent hex.

If the Navigator is familiar with the area, they cannot get lost.

### Scout

The *Scout* is in charge of looking out for hostile creatures. When a [Random Encounter](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Encounters/Random%20Encounters.md) occurs, the GM may call for a [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) from the scout to determine the distance at which they spot the creature, and whether or not either side is [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md).

### Quartermaster

The *Quartermaster* is in charge of managing supplies, ensuring there is enough food and drink, and, mechanically speaking, accounting the expenditure of resources when appropriate.
