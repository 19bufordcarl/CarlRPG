# Overland Journeys

## Define the Journey

Before journeying to a destination, the PCs and GM should determine the following:

- Path (Determine the mode of [Travel](Overland%20Journeys.md#Travel), [Terrain](Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain), and [Journey Hazard Die](Overland%20Journeys.md#Journey%20Hazard%20Die))
- [Roles](Overland%20Journeys.md#Roles) (Each PC should choose a role to serve on the journey)

If the party is traveling in a safe area, the journey can be abstracted into the total time, rations, and other resources it will take to reach the destination, which are then consumed.

Otherwise, it is a [Hex Crawl](Hex%20Crawl.md).

## Travel

If the PCs travel longer than 12 hours in a day, they become [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) and lose all [Reroll Tokens](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md).

| Mode     | Hexes per Day | Speed |
| -------- | ------------: | ----: |
| Walk     |             4 | ~2mph |
| Mount    |             6 | ~3mph |
| Nautical |             8 | ~4mph |
| Special  |            10 | ~5mph |

*This assumes that a hex is roughly 6 miles wide, and the PCs travel 12 hours per day*

## Terrain

A hex that is difficult terrain counts as two hexes to travel across. Some hexes are impassable. The GM determines whether a hex is difficult terrain or impassable.

## Journey Hazard Die

The GM rolls the journey hazard die when the party enters a hex *OR* takes a [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest) in a hex. On a result of 1, there is an encounter. The GM determines the danger level of the entered hex.

| Danger Level | Journey Hazard Die |
| ------------ | -----------------: |
| Normal       |                d20 |
| Risky        |                d12 |
| Deadly       |                 d6 |

*GMs, see [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Encounters/Random%20Encounters.md).*

## Roles

The following roles determine what each party member is doing during the journey.

There should be at least one of each role filled. If multiple players do the same role, the one with the higher [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) rolls with [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

### Navigator

The *Navigator* is in charge of making sure the party stays on path towards their destination using maps and landmarks. If the terrain could be confusing, the GM makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) for the Navigator in secret. On a failure, the party moves to a random adjacent hex.

If the party is following a well known path with no obstacles, the Navigator cannot get lost.

### Scout

The *Scout* is in charge of looking out for hostile creatures. When a [Random Encounter](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Encounters/Random%20Encounters.md) occurs, the GM may call for a [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) from the scout to determine the distance at which they spot the creature, and whether or not either side is [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md).

### Quartermaster

The *Quartermaster* is in charge of managing supplies, ensuring there is enough food and drink, and, mechanically speaking, accounting the expenditure of resources when appropriate.
