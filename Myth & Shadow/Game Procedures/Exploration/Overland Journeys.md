# Overland Journeys

## Define the Journey

Before journeying to a destination, the PCs and GM should determine the following:

- Path (Determine the [Terrain](Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain) and [Danger Level](Overland%20Journeys.md#Danger%20Level))
- [Roles](Overland%20Journeys.md#Roles) (Each PC should choose a role to serve on the journey)

If the party is traveling in a safe area, the journey can be abstracted into the total time, rations, and other resources it will take to reach the destination, which are then consumed.

Otherwise, it is a [Hex Crawl](Hex%20Crawl.md).

## Terrain

A hex's terrain determines the time it takes to traverse it.

| Terrain     | Time to Traverse a Hex             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Normal      | 1 [Watch](Watches.md) (3 hours)    |
| Difficult   | 2 [Watches](Watches.md) (6 hours)  |
| Treacherous | 4 [Watches](Watches.md) (12 hours) |

*These times assume that hexes on the map are somewhere between 3 and 6 miles long.*

## Danger Level

According to the hex's danger level, roll the journey hazard die when the party enters a new hex. On a result of 1, there is an encounter.

| Danger Level | Journey Hazard Die |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Normal       | d20                |
| Risky        | d12                |
| Deadly       | d6                 |

*GMs, see [Random Encounters](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Random%20Encounters.md).*

## Roles

The following roles determine what each party member is doing during the journey.

There should be at least one of each role filled. If multiple players do the same role, the one with the higher [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) rolls with [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

### Navigator

The navigator is in charge of making sure the party stays on path towards their desired destination using maps and landmarks. If the party could encounter creatures of a higher [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than the Navigator's [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) along this path, then the GM makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check for the player in secret. If they fail, the party moves to a random adjacent hex.

If the party is following a well known path with no obstacles, the Navigator cannot get lost.

### Scout

The scout is in charge of looking out for hostile creatures. When an encounter occurs, the GM may call for a [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check from the scout to determine the distance at which they spot the creature, and whether or not either side is [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md).

### Quartermaster

The quartermaster is in charge of managing supplies, ensuring there is enough food and drink, and, mechanically speaking, accounting the expenditure of resources when appropriate.
