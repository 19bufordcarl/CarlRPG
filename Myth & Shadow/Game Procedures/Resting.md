# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.
## Short Rest
A short rest is a period of 1 hour (10 delve [Rounds](Round.md)) doing next to no movement or physical activity. You regain all [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) when you short rest.
- You can do light mental activity, such as [Spell Scroll Memorization](../Magic/Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Memorization).
	- This is quite risky to do if your are in a dangerous environment, see [Interruption](Resting.md#Interruption).
- You cannot do heavy mental activity like [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md).
### Interruption 
If a short rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, you must stop [Spell Scroll Memorization](../Magic/Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Memorization), to engage, which causes a random spell being swapped to be forgotten.
- You can choose to not engage, but if you take damage, you must succeed a [DC](DC.md) 20 [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](Check.md) or be forcibly interrupted.

You regain [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) as you would have normally. (Xd4 + (X times [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md))) where X is the number of rounds into the short rest before you were interrupted.
## Long Rest
A long rest must be at least 8 hours long (2 [Watches](Watches.md)) and consumes 1 ration. After a long rest, all [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are restored, [Exhaustion](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) is cured, as are conditions that specify removal after a long, or full night of rest.
- You can split the rest into two pieces (at most 1 watch in between them) and still benefit.
- Long resting is necessary to avoid [Sleep Deprivation](../Hazards/Biological.md).
- You can do light mental activity, such as [Spell Scroll Memorization](../Magic/Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Memorization).
- You can do heavy mental activity such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) for at most 1 hour.
### Interruption 
If a long rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, the PCs still gain the benefits of the rest provided there was only one interruption and it was less than 1 hour long.

If there were multiple interruptions, or they lasted longer than 1 hour, a PC must succeed a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check. If they fail, they only receive the benefits of a short rest.

If a PC was engaged in [Spell Scroll Memorization](../Magic/Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Memorization), roll a d6. On a 1, the interruption occurs during that activity.
- For spell swap interruption, see [Interruption](Resting.md#Interruption) for short rests.
- For heavy mental activity, they must stop the activity to engage in combat.
	- They suffer a [Critical Miscast](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) if the activity involved [The Spellcasting Roll](../Magic/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
	- Any damage they take **forces** them to stop activity and thus suffer a [Critical Miscast](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md).
## Full Rest
A full rest is a full day (6 [Watches](Watches.md)) spent primarily resting. A full rest confers all the benefits of a long rest. Additionally a full rest confers the following benefits.
- Restore [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) equal to [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) (minimum 1).
- Restore any temporary ability damage, unless stated otherwise.

Additionally, some [Conditions](../Conditions/!Conditions.md) are healed / removed after a full rest, but not a long rest.

You can do heavy mental activity such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) for at most 2 hours this day.
### Interruption 
The first time a full rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, a PC must make a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](Check.md) to receive the benefits of the rest. The [DC](DC.md) increases by 5 per subsequent interruption. On a failed check the PC can only receive the benefits of a long rest until the next day.

If a PC was engaged in mental activity roll a d6 for each activity. On a 1, the interruption occurs during that activity. See [Interruption](Resting.md#Interruption) for long rests.
