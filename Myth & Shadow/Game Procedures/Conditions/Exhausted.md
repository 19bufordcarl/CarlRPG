# Exhausted

An exhausted creature has their [Max HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md#Max%20HP) set to 1.

PCs cease being exhausted after a [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

When a creature becomes exhausted, they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) if concentrating.
