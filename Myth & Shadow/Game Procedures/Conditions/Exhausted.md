# Exhausted

An exhausted creature has its [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) set to 0 and they cannot be restored.

If an exhausted creature takes damage, it immediately falls [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).

Exhaustion is removed after a [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

When a creature becomes exhausted, it makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md) check if concentrating.
