# Exhausted

An exhausted creature does not regain [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md), [SP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), or [MP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) when they [Recover](../Core%20Procedures/Break.md#Recover) or [Short Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest).

*PCs cease being exhausted after a [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).*
