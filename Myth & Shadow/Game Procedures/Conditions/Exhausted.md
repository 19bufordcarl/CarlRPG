An exhausted creature does not regain [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) when they [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover), [Short Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest), or [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

PCs cease being exhausted after a [Long Rest](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
