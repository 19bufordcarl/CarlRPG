# Stabilized

A stabilized PC is no longer [Dying](Dying.md), but still has 0 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md).

They regain 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) after being stabilized for 1 [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round).

If they take damage, they start [Dying](Dying.md).
