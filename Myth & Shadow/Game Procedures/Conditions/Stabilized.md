# Stabilized

A stabilized PC is no longer [Dying](Dying.md), but still has 0 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md).

They regain 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) at the end of [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md).

If they take damage, they start [Dying](Dying.md).
