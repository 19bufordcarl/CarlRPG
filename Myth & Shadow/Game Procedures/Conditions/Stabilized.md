# Stabilized

A stabilized PC is no longer [Dying](Dying.md), but they still have 0 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).

They restore 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and wake up in 1 [Delve Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) â€” roughly 6 minutes.
