# Blinded

A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) requiring sight.

They also have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Melee Attacks](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) and cannot use [Ranged Attacks](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md) except against targets that they are [Engaged](Engaged.md) with.
