# Blinded

A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) requiring sight.

If they rely on sight for their primary sense:

- They have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md).
- They cannot use [Ranged Attacks](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md), except against targets that they are [Engaged](Engaged.md) with.
- They have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on any [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) that is aided by sight.
