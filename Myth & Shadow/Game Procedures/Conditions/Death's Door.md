# Death's Door

When a PC gains a [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) that puts them over their 5 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) maximum number of allowed [Scars](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md), they gain the [Death's Door](Death's%20Door.md) condition ("they are at *Death's Door*").

- If a scar is healed, putting them under their threshold, they cease being at *Death's Door*.

While at *Death's Door*, if that PC gains the [Dying](Dying.md) condition, they [Die](Dying.md#Dead) instantly.

## Blaze of Glory

If a PC is at [Death's Door](Death's%20Door.md), or has ever been at *Death's Door*, they can go out in a blaze of glory.

- The PC [Dies](Dying.md#Dead) at the end of this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md)
- The PC automatically [Critically Succeeds](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) everything this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md)
- The PC can propose any 1 effect to the GM to help their comrades
	- Within reason to the PCs [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)
	- A good rule of thumb is it can be roughly as powerful as a spell one level higher than they would be capable of casting if they were a spellcaster
