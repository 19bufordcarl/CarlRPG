# Engaged

The default range for melee is 5 feet.

A creature that is within [Melee Attack](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) range of another creature is engaged with them.

A creature that is engaged in melee with a **hostile** combatant has the following penalties:

- They have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) unless the [Spell](../../Magic/Spells.md) has a [Spell Range](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Attributes.md#Spell%20Range) of *Touch*.
- They have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Ranged Attacks](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md).
- They cannot stand up from [Prone](Prone.md) if the hostile is not [Prone](Prone.md).

*Objects can also count as engaged when relevant*.
