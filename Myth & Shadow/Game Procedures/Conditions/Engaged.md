# Engaged

A creature that is within [Melee Attack](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) range of another creature is engaged with them.

A creature that is engaged in melee with a **hostile** combatant is vulnerable to [Opportunity Attacks](../Combat/Opportunity%20Attack.md).

Objects can also count as engaged when relevant.

*The default range for a [Melee Attack](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) is roughly 5 feet.*
