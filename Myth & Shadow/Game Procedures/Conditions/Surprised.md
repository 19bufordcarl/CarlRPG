# Surprised

A creature is considered surprised if it was unaware of *all* hostile creatures when [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) began. The GM determines surprise before [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md) is rolled.

A surprised creature's initiative rolls are automatically treated as a natural one.

Surprised is removed from a creature after its [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md) is determined.
