# Surprised

A creature is considered surprised if they were unaware of *all* hostile creatures when [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) began. The GM determines surprise before [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md) starts.

A surprised creature acts last in [Initiative](../Combat/Initiative.md).

Surprised is removed from a creature at the end of a [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).
