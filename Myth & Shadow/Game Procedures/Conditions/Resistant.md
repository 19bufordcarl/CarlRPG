# Resistant

A creature resistant to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) takes [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) damage from it.

If that damage requires them to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), they have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on that check.

Cancels out [Vulnerable](Vulnerable.md) for that [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).
