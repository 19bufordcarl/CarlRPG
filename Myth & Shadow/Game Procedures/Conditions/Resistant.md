# Resistant

If a creature is resistant to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md), it takes [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) damage from that damage type.

If that damage requires it to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), it has [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on that check.
*To save against poison or disease, for example*
