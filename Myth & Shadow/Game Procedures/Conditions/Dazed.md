# Dazed

A dazed creature can either use [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) or take an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md), but not both.

When a creature becomes dazed, they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) if concentrating.
