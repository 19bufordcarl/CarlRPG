# Wet

A creature immersed in water becomes wet.

If a wet creature is either a [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) or an [Animal](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), they are [Vulnerable](Vulnerable.md) to [Cold](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) and [Lightning](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and [Resistant](Resistant.md) to [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage so long as they are wet.

Wet is removed when a creature dries off.
