# Wet

A creature immersed in water becomes wet.

If a wet creature is a [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) or an [Animal](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), they are [Vulnerable](Vulnerable.md) to [Cold](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) and [Lightning](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage.

A wet creature is [Resistant](Resistant.md) to [Tier 1](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Fire](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage and ceases [Burning](Burning.md).

Wet is removed when a creature dries off.
