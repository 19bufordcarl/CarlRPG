# Wet

A creature immersed in water becomes wet.

If a wet creature is a [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) or an [Animal](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), they are [Vulnerable](Vulnerable.md) to [Cold](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) and [Lightning](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage.

A wet creature ceases [Burning](Burning.md) with [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) and/or [Acid](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage.

Wet is removed when a creature dries off.
