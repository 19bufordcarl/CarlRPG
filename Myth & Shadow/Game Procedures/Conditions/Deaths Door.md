# Death's Door

When a PC gains a [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) that puts them over their [Max Scar Threshold](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md#Max%20Scar%20Threshold), they gain the [Deaths Door](Deaths%20Door.md) condition. *You say, "they are at Death's Door"*.

While at *Death's Door*, if that PC gains the [Dying](Dying.md) condition, they [Die](Dying.md#Dead) instantly.

If a scar is healed, putting them back under their threshold, they cease being at *Death's Door*.

## Blaze of Glory

If a PC is at [Deaths Door](Deaths%20Door.md), or has ever been at *Death's Door*, they can go out in a *Blaze of Glory*.

If a PC chooses to go out in a *Blaze of Glory*, the following happens:

- The PC [Dies](Dying.md#Dead) at the end of this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md)
- The PC automatically [Critically Succeeds](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) everything this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md)
- The PC can propose any 1 effect to the GM to help their comrades
	- Within reason to the PCs [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) and capabilities
