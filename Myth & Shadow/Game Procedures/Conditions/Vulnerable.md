# Vulnerable

A creature vulnerable to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) takes double damage from it.

If that damage requires them to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), they have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on that check.

If you are vulnerable to a certain [Damage Tier](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/{Damage%20Tiers}.md), you are also vulnerable to all its higher tiers.

Cancels out [Resistant](Resistant.md) for that [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).
