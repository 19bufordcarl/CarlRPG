# Vulnerable

If you are vulnerable to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) you take double damage from that damage type.

If that damage requires you to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), you have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on that check.
