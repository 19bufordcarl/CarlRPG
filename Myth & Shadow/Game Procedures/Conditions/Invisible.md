# Invisible

An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic. Its location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

Any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) made by the invisible creature against creatures that cannot see it has [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

Any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) made against the invisible creature by creatures that cannot see it automatically miss, unless it has an area of effect. These attacks can only be made if the attacker detects the invisible creature through noise, tracks, or other markers.
