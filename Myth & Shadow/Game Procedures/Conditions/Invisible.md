# Invisible

An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic.

Their location can be detected by any noise they make or any tracks they leave.

An [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) made by an invisible creature against creatures that cannot see them has [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

A [Melee Attack](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) made against the invisible creature has [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

[Ranged Attacks](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md) require sight and thus cannot be made against an invisible creature.

Most [Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md) require sight and thus cannot target something [Invisible](Invisible.md).
