# Immune

A creature immune to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) takes no damage from it.

If that damage would cause a creature to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), they automatically succeed.

They are also immune to any negative affects or [Conditions]({Conditions}.md) resulting from that damage.
