# Immune

A creature immune to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) takes no damage from it.

If that damage would cause a creature to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), it automatically succeeds it and is immune to any other results of that check as well.

*Ex. Immunity to poison damage would also stop that poison from making you fall [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).*
