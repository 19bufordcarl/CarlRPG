# Immune

A creature immune to a [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) takes no damage from it.

If that damage would cause a creature to make a [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md), they automatically succeed.

They are also immune to any negative affects or [Conditions]({Conditions}.md) resulting from that damage.

If you are immune to a certain [Damage Tier](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/{Damage%20Tiers}.md), you are also immune to all its lower tiers.

Replaces [Resistant](Resistant.md) and [Vulnerable](Vulnerable.md) for that [Damage Type](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).
