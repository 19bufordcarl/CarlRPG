# Incapacitated

An incapacitated creature cannot take [Actions](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md), [Reactions](../Combat/Reaction.md), or [Move](../Combat/Movement.md).

When a creature becomes incapacitated, it makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md) check if concentrating.
