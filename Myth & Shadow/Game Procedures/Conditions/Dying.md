# Dying

A PC with 0 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is dying. When a PC starts dying:

- The PC becomes [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
- The PC becomes [Exhausted](Exhausted.md).
- The PC gains 1 [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).

## Death Saves

While dying, at the start of the PCs [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), they roll a d20 called a *Death Save*.

|   d20 | Effect                                                                                                                                  |
| ----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     1 | The PC gains **two** more [Scars](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md)                                              |
|   2-9 | The PC gains another [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md)                                                    |
| 10-19 | Nothing — The PC lies in agony                                                                                                          |
|    20 | The PC regains 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and is no longer [Unconscious](Unconscious.md) |

## Damage

If a PC takes damage while [Dying](Dying.md), they gain **two** more [Scars](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).

## Healing

When a dying PC's [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is restored, they wake up and are no longer [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
*Reminder: They are still [Exhausted](Exhausted.md)*.

### Stabilization

An ally can [Stabilize](Stabilized.md) a PC as an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md). A [Stabilized](Stabilized.md) PC is still [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).

## Dead

Dead PCs are retired from play into the hall of fame — or infamy.

A PC dies when they exceed their [Max Scar Threshold](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md#Max%20Scar%20Threshold) ***and*** they have the [Dying](Dying.md) condition.
*See [Deaths Door](Deaths%20Door.md)*.

Powerful magic can cause instant death.

*Note: NPCs do not get the **Dying** condition, they just die*.
