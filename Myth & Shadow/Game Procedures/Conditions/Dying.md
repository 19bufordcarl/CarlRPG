# Dying

When a PC starts dying, the following happens

- The PC becomes [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
- The PC becomes [Exhausted](Exhausted.md).
- The PC gains 1 [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).
- The PC rolls a d4 to determine their number of [Turns Until Death](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter).

## Turns Until Death Counter

When a PC starts dying, they roll a d4 and add [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). This number is the "Turns Until Death Counter". The PC [Dies](#Dead) after that many [Turns](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). (Minimum of 1 turn).

*This does not apply to NPCs*

## Death Saves

While dying, at the start of the PCs [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), they roll a d20.

- On a natural 20, they regain consciousness with 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
	- Otherwise, they decrease their [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) by 1.
- Each *point* of damage they take while dying decreases their [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) by 1.
- The moment a PC's [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0, they [Die](#Dead).

*Ex. I start dying and I roll a 1 on my d4 and have 0 CON. On my following turn I roll a 14. My 'turns until death counter' becomes 0. I die right there. I do not pass go. I do not collect $200.*

## Healing

- An ally can [Stabilize](Stabilized.md) the PC as an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) with a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) check.
- If a PC's [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is restored 1 or more by means other than [Stabilization](Stabilized.md):
	- The PC wakes up and is no longer [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
	- *Reminder: The PC is still [Exhausted](Exhausted.md)*

## Dead

Dead PCs are retired from play into the hall of fame (or infamy).

The moment a PC's [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0, they die.

Some things can cause a PC to die instantly.

*The player can have the PC regain consciousness to say some final words if they so desire.*
