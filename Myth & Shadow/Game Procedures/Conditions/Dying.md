# Dying

A PC with 0 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is dying. When this happens:

- The PC becomes [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
- The PC becomes [Exhausted](Exhausted.md).
- The PC gains 1 [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).
- The PC rolls a d4 to determine their number of [Turns Until Death](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter).

## Turns Until Death Counter

When a PC starts dying, they roll a d4 and add [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) + 1. This number is the "Turns Until Death Counter". The PC [Dies](#Dead) after that many [Turns](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) â€” minimum of 1.

The moment a PC's [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0, they [Die](#Dead).

If a PC takes damage while [Dying](Dying.md), they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check or die.

On a success, they gain another [Scar](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).

## Death Saves

While dying, at the start of the PCs [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), they roll a d20.

On a natural 20, they regain consciousness with 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.

Otherwise, they decrease their [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) by 1.

*Ex. I start dying and I roll a 1 on my d4 and have -1 CON. On my next turn I roll a 14. My 'turns until death counter' becomes 0. I die right there. I do not pass go. I do not collect $200.*

## Healing

An ally can [Stabilize](Stabilized.md) the PC as an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) with a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) check.

When a dying PC's [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is restored, they wake up and are no longer [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
*Reminder: They are still [Exhausted](Exhausted.md)*.

## Dead

Dead PCs are retired from play into the hall of fame (or infamy).

The moment a PC's [Turns Until Death Counter](#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0, they die.

Some powerful monsters may be able to kill a PC outright (no turn counter).

*Note: NPCs do not start dying, they just die*
