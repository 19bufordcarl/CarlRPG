# Prone

A prone creature's only [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) option is to crawl (difficult). Additionally:

- It has [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) rolls.
- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) if their attacker is within 5 feet.
- It can stand up by using 5 feet of [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) and end this condition.
- It cannot stand up if it is [Threatened](Threatened.md).
- If it was flying (or similar) when it became prone, it immediately starts falling.
