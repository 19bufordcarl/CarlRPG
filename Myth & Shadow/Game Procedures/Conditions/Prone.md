# Prone

A prone creature's only [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) option is to crawl, which is difficult movement. Additionally:

- They have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) rolls.
- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against them have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) if the attacker is [Engaged](Engaged.md) with them.
- They can stand up by using 5 feet of [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) and end this condition.
	- *They cannot leave their current zone if playing with [Abstract](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) distance*.
- They cannot stand up if they are [Engaged](Engaged.md) with a non-prone hostile combatant.
- If they were flying, or similar, when they became prone, they immediately start falling.
