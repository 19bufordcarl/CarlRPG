# Threatened

While a creature is in range of a combatant capable of making a [Melee Attack](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) against it, it is considered threatened.

While a creature is threatened, [Ranged Attacks](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md) against targets in its melee range have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

*A creature's natural attacks such as claws count as melee weapons*
