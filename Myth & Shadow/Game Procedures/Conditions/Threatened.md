A creature that is within [Melee Attack](../Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) range of a hostile combatant is threatened.

A threatened creature has [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) and [Ranged Attacks](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md).

*A creature's natural attacks such as claws count as melee weapons*
