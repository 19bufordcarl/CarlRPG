# Unconscious

An unconscious creature is [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md), [Blinded](Blinded.md), [Deafened](Deafened.md), and can't speak. Additionally:

- It drops whatever it is holding and falls [Prone](Prone.md).
- It automatically fails [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) and [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks.
- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).
- Any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) that hits it is a [Critical Hit](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Hit.md) provided the attacker is within 5 feet.
- When a creature becomes unconscious, it loses [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md).
