# Unconscious

While a creature is unconscious it is [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md), can't speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.

- It drops whatever it is holding and falls [Prone](Prone.md).
- It automatically fails [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) and [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks.
- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).
- Any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) that hits it is a [Critical Hit](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Hit.md) provided the attacker is within 5 feet.
