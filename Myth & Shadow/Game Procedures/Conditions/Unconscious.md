# Unconscious

An unconscious creature is [Paralyzed](Paralyzed.md), [Blinded](Blinded.md), [Deafened](Deafened.md), and can't speak. Additionally:

- They drop whatever they are holding and fall [Prone](Prone.md).
- When a creature becomes unconscious, it loses [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md).
