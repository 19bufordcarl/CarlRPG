# Poisoned X

A poisoned creature takes X [Necrotic](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage at the end of their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

Different poisons have different [Damage Tiers](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/{Damage%20Tiers}.md).

By default, being poisoned deals 1 [Tier 1](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Necrotic](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.

*Without an antidote, poison will kill the creature.*
