# Poisoned X

A poisoned creature takes X [Mundane Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) at the start of its [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

Magical poisons may do different [Damage Types](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).

*Without an antidote, poison will kill the creature.*
