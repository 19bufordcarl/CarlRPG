# Paralyzed

A paralyzed creature is [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md). Additionally:

- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against them haveÂ [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).
- Any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) that hits them is a [Critical Hit](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Hit.md) if the attacker is [Engaged](Engaged.md) with them.
- They automatically fail [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Checks](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md).
