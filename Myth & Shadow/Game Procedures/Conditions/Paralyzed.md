# Paralyzed

A paralyzed creature is [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md) and can't speak.

It automatically fails [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) and [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

[Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against it haveÂ [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

Any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) that hits it is a [Critical Hit](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Hit.md) if the attacker is within 5 feet of it.
