# Restrained

A restrained creature's [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) is 0 and it cannot be increased. Additionally:

- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against them have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md), and their [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).
- They have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md).
- If the cause of the restrain becomes impossible then the [Restrained](Restrained.md) condition ends.
- *Ex. a creature that has you grappled is pushed out of range*.

When a creature becomes restrained, they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Concentration](../../Magic/Spells/Concentration.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) if concentrating.
