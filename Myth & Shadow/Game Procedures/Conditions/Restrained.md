# Restrained

A restrained creature's [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) is 0 and it cannot be increased. Additionally:

- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md), and its [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).
- It has [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) checks.
- If the cause of the restrain becomes impossible then the [Restrained]() condition ends.
- *(Ex. a creature that has you grappled is push out of range)*
