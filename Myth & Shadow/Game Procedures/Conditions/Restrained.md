# Restrained

A restrained creature's [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to movement.

[Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md), and its [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

It has [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md) checks.

If the cause of the restrain becomes impossible *(Ex. a creature that has you grappled is push out of range)* then the [Restrained]() condition end.
