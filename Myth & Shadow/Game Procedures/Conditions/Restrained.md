# Restrained

A restrained creature cannot use [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md). Additionally:

- [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) against them have [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).
- Their [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).
- The cannot do [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).

If the cause of the restrain becomes impossible, then the [Restrained](Restrained.md) condition ends.
