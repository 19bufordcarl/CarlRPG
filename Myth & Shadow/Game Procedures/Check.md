# Check

A check is made to resolve an uncertain situation with stakes. (Also known as a "d20 roll" or "roll").

A check is made by rolling a d20 and then adding the relevant [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) as a bonus (also called a modifier) to get the result. If it is your [Favored Ability](../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), you double it for this bonus.
## Check Resolution
The check is successful if it meets or exceeds the difficulty class ([DC](DC.md)) of the target. Otherwise, the check is considered a failure.
## Contested Check
A contested check is made by doing the following:

The active creature makes an ability [Check](Check.md), with a [DC](DC.md) equal to the target's ability [Check](Check.md).
## Critical Rolls
A result of 20 (natural 20) is a [Critical Success](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md).

A result of 1 (natural 1) is a [Critical Failure](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md).


*Author's Notes:*
*Something that bothers me in most versions of d20 fantasy games is that it is not uncommon for a supremely skilled character to fail a check that a novice succeeds. Take a DC 15 check to in Shadowdark. Say it is to successfully use some magic item. The 10th level wizard has a +4. This is a 50% chance. A normal person would have a 25% chance. Those are both pretty bad odds, and there is a 12.5% chance that if they both try, the wizard would fail and the normal person succeeds. Maybe the GM could give out advantage / disadvantage, but in my opinion this wider disparity of skill can be built into the system without adding much complexity, and gives the players a bit more agency.* 

*Now that being said, the flattened math of Shadowdark is something that I like a lot, which is why damage, spell level, and any sort of scaling that impacts the damage a player can do / take is typically their ability score (cap 10), but we have damage reduction (cap ~5). This means it effectively caps out at +5, only a bit lower than Shadowdark's +7, but against worse enemies it'll be +10, so it averages around to +7.5, perfect. Essentially what I've done is kept the flattened math for damage and HP, but un-flattened it for other things because it lets characters feel more unique when it comes to their skills. Personally, there is nothing that frustrates me more in RPGs than your high level PC failing the saving throw you supposedly specialized in because you have a +6 but it was a DC 15. This way, players can get big bonuses, so failing checks will feel less like bad luck and more like decision they made.*

*To the crowd that says, "checks should be a last resort for the players, ideally they describe their actions in such a way that the GM doesn't call for a check at all", I agree. This is for balancing the difference between characters. Skill disparity should be wide for things that require a lot of expertise. For unique scenarios that come up in game, the referee should just set a really high [DC](DC.md) if the players described their action in such a way that seems very difficult. The DCs are higher than Shadowdark's to accommodate for this. You can still make the 10th level Wizard only 50% to succeed that magic item check since they didn't describe to you how they intended to defeat the puzzle rune. Give that thing a DC 30 (nearly impossible) and they need to roll a 10. The difference in this system is that a commoner is only succeeding on a natural 20, assuming the referee even lets them try.*

*Since AC is changed to be much lower, this doesn't have the undesirable effect that you can't even hit higher level enemies and vice versa ala 3e / pathfinder. It just means it becomes **possible** for you to miss on rolls other than a nat 1. If have low martial stats as a high level caster, using your backup crossbow from level 1 against the Vampire King is a really bad idea, because yeah, you might not even hit this fool, they're the **Vampire King**. Cast a spell you doofus, your PC is a caster.*
