# Darkness

## Normal Darkness

While a PC or other [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) is in normal darkness, they have [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Attacks](../Combat/Attack.md).

*Moonlight, starlight, etc.*

## Shadowcursed Darkness

While a PC or other [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) is in the [Shadowcurse](Shadowcurse.md) without a light source:

- They cannot use their map to navigate.
- They are considered [Blinded](../Conditions/Blinded.md).
- All danger levels count as deadly â€” see [Delving Hazard Die](../Exploration/Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) and [Journey Hazard Die](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Journey%20Hazard%20Die).
