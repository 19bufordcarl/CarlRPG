# Darkness

While a PC or other [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) is in total darkness:

- They cannot use their map to navigate.
- They make all [Checks](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) at [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).
- They are considered [Blinded](../Conditions/Blinded.md).
- All danger levels count as deadly â€” see [Delving Hazard Die](../Exploration/Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) and [Journey Hazard Die](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Journey%20Hazard%20Die).

Standard light items last 1 hour, or 10 [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round).

See the [Shadowcurse](Shadowcurse.md) for more darkness rules.
