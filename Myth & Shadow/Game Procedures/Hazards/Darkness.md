# Darkness

If the party finds itself in total darkness, they cannot use their map to navigate and most actions will be at [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) or impossible. They are considered [Blinded](../Conditions/Blinded.md). Standard light items last 1 hour, or 10 [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). See the [Shadowcurse](Shadowcurse.md) for more light and darkness rules.

While in total darkness, treat all danger levels as deadly â€” [Delving Hazard Die](../Exploration/Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die), [Danger Level](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Danger%20Level).
