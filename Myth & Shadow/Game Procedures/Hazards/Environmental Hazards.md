# Environmental Hazards

## Fire

### Lava

Creatures that touch lava for the first time on a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) take 1d100 [Fire](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.

### Extreme Heat

Creatures [Journeying](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md) in severely hot [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Fire](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage whenever they enter a hex. They take 2d6 if the hex is risky, and 3d6 if the hex is deadly.

## Water

### Drowning

Creatures can hold their breath in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) for a number of [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) equal to their [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). They then fall [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md). Out of [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), increase this by 5 [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

While [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) underwater, [Humanoids](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) and [Animals](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) that cannot breathe water take 2d10 [Mundane Damage](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) at the end of their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

## Air

### Extreme Cold

Creatures [Journeying](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md) in severely cold [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Cold](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage whenever they enter a hex. They take 2d6 if the hex is risky, and 3d6 if the hex is deadly.

## Earth
