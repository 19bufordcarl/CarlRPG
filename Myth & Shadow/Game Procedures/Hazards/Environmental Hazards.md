# Elemental Hazards

## General

### Burning

A creature that is subjected to an adverse ongoing effect (is either: on fire, covered in acid, freezing solid, or being electrocuted) takes 1d6 [Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) of the relevant element per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

### Darkness

See [Darkness](Darkness.md).

## Fire

### Lava

Creatures that touch lava take 1d100 [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

### Extreme Heat

Creatures traveling in severely hot [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per level of danger they are in whenever they enter a hex.

## Water

### Drowning

Creatures can hold their breath for 5 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md). After that, they start [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md).

### Cold Water

Creatures immersed in freezing water take 1 [Cold](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage at the end of every minute. This damage doubles for every minute spent immersed.

## Air

### Extreme Cold

Creatures traveling in severely cold [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Cold](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage per level of danger they are in whenever they enter a hex.

## Earth

### Falling

Entities take 1d6 [Mundane Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) per 10 feet fallen.

If this would require too many dice, you may instead roll 2d6 and multiple the result by [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the number of 1d6 that you should have rolled.
