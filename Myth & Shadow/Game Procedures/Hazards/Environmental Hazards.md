# Environmental Hazards

## Fire

### Lava

Creatures that touch lava take 1d100 [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

### Extreme Heat

Creatures [Journeying](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md) in severely hot [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage whenever they enter a hex. They take 2d6 if the hex is risky, and 3d6 if the hex is deadly.

## Water

### Drowning

Creatures can hold their breath for 1d10 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) and then fall [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md).

While [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) underwater, [Humanoids](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) and [Animals](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) take 10 [Mundane Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## Air

### Extreme Cold

Creatures [Journeying](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md) in severely cold [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Cold](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage whenever they enter a hex. They take 2d6 if the hex is risky, and 3d6 if the hex is deadly.

## Earth

### Falling

Entities take 1d6 [Mundane Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) when they fall 10 feet. This doubles for each additional 10 feet.

If this would require too many dice, you may instead roll 2d6 and multiple the result by [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the number of d6s that you should have rolled.

## Darkness

See [Darkness](Darkness.md).
