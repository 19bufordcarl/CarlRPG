### Lava

Creatures that touch lava for the first time on a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) take 1d100+20 [Tier 2](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Fire](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.

### Extreme Heat

Creatures [Journeying](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md) in severely hot [Weather](Weather.md) take 1d6 [Tier 1](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Fire](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage whenever they enter a hex. They take 2d6 if the hex is risky, and 3d6 if the hex is deadly.

## Water

### Drowning

Creatures can hold their breath in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) for a number of [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) equal to the greater of their [Health](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) or [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md). They then fall [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md). Out of [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), increase this by 5 [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

While [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) underwater, creatures that cannot breathe water take 2d10 [Tier 1](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Necrotic](../Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage at the end of their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
