# Elemental Hazards

## General

### Burning

A creature that is subjected to an adverse ongoing effect (is either: on fire, covered in acid, freezing solid, or being electrocuted) takes 1d6 [Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) of the relevant element per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## Fire

### Lava

1d100 [Fire](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

### Extreme Heat

Creatures in severely hot weather make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check at the end of each watch not spent [Resting](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md). On a failure, they take 1 *temporary* [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) damage.

## Water

### Drowning

Creatures can hold their breath for 30 seconds (5 [Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md)) plus a number of rounds equal to their [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md). After that number of rounds, they start [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md).

### Cold Water

Creatures immersed in freezing water must make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check at the end of every minute. On a failure, they take 1 *temporary* [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) damage.

## Air

### Extreme Cold

Creatures in severely cold weather make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check at the end of each watch not spent [Resting](../Core%20Procedures/Resting.md). On a failure, they take 1 *temporary* [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) damage.

## Earth

### Falling

Entities take 1d6 [Mundane Damage](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) per 10 feet fallen.

If this would require too many dice, you may instead roll 2d6 and multiple the result by [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the number of 1d6 that you should have rolled.
