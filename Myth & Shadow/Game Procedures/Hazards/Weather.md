# Weather

The following tables can be used by the GM to generate the weather.

Subtract 1 from the roll for a region with bad weather. You may subtract more, or create a region with a near permanent [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) if you so desire.

| 2d6 | Weather Type | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --: | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2 | Severe       | A [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) applies. Cannot move out of this [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).                         |
| 3-4 | Bad          | A [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) applies. Increase the [Danger Die](../Exploration/Danger%20Clock.md#Danger%20Die) by one step. |
| 5-6 | Meh          | Something atmospheric, but nothing mechanical.                                                                                                |
|  7+ | Good         | A nice day.                                                                                                                                   |

*A [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) is either [Extreme Heat](Environmental%20Hazards.md#Extreme%20Heat) or [Extreme Cold](Environmental%20Hazards.md#Extreme%20Cold)*.
