# Weather

The following tables can be used to generate the weather.

Subtract 1 from the roll for a region with bad weather. You may subtract more, or create a region with a near permanent [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) if you so desire.

| 2d6 | Weather Type | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --: | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2 | Severe       | A [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) applies. [Terrain](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain) becomes impassable until it clears. |
| 3-4 | Bad          | A [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) applies. [Terrain](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain) becomes difficult.                  |
| 5-6 | Meh          | Something atmospheric, but nothing mechanical                                                                                                |
|  7+ | Good         | A nice day                                                                                                                                   |

*A [Weather Hazard](Environmental%20Hazards.md) is either [Extreme Heat](Environmental%20Hazards.md#Extreme%20Heat) or [Extreme Cold](Environmental%20Hazards.md#Extreme%20Cold)*.
