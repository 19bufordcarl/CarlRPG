# Biological Hazards

When the PCs are in civilization, they can simply deduct 1 coin per person at the end of the day to buy cheap meals and poor lodging.

## Hunger

- Not eating for a day prevents the benefits of [Resting](../Exploration/Resting.md) and grants the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

## Thirst

- Not drinking for a day prevents the benefits of [Resting](../Exploration/Resting.md) and grants the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
- After three days, once per hour the PC makes a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check or dies.
- *If PCs are near fresh water, they are assumed to be refilling their waterskins automatically.*

## Sleep Derivation

- After one night without sleep, a PCs [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are drained to 0.
	- If they go another day without sleep, they gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
		- Each subsequent watch the PC must succeed a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 + days awake [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check to remain awake, or they collapse [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md).

## Drunkenness

- For each hour a PC spends drinking, they make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are drunk and take 1d6 [Necrotic](../Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.
	- If this damage causes a loss of [Health Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), they fall [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) too.
	- A drunk character gains the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
	- *This does not prevent them from gaining the benefits of [Resting](../Exploration/Resting.md).*
