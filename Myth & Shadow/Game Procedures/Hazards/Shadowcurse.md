# Shadowcurse

The Shadowcurse is a blight on the world of **Mithrinia**.

Areas affected by the Shadowcurse without a sufficient light source are [Shadowcursed Darkness](Darkness.md#Shadowcursed%20Darkness).

## Time

While in the Shadowcurse, it is recommended that light tracking uses a real-life timer instead of lasting the predictable 10 [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) for 1 hour effects.

Lights with a timer of 1 hour last (d20 + 40) minutes. This timer is hidden from the players.

When [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md), if players decide to do something that will multiple [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round), the GM adjusts the light timer down 6 minutes for each round this longer action takes.

## Lore

*The origins of the Shadowcurse are a mystery, it is believed to have begun before **The Dawn**, cursing the lands of Mithrinia since before recorded history. Anywhere in total darkness starts to be consumed by the Shadowcurse. Moonlight and starlight keep the overworld from the curse, but in the underworld the Shadowcurse has taken hold. Inky darkness, unnatural silence, and strange smells pervade areas afflicted with the Shadowcurse.*

*Strange and usually dangerous creatures called [Monstrosities](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Monstrosity.md) seep in to inhabit the Shadowcursed underworld. [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) and [Demons](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Demon.md) often move in to rule over an area afflicted by the Shadowcurse. Light sources are paramount to [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) survival in the Shadowcurse.*

*The Shadowcurse does not take hold immediately; the lights going out in a village basement won't cause ghouls to crawl out of the ground. But, after enough time in the dark, the Shadowcurse inevitably takes hold, and all sorts of unnatural creatures pour in from its dark depths.*
