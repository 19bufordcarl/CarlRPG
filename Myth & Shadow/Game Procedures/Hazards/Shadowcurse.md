# Shadowcurse

The Shadowcurse is a blight on the world of **Mithrinia**.

Areas affected by the Shadowcurse without a light source are [Shadowcursed Darkness](Darkness.md#Shadowcursed%20Darkness).

## The Shadow Timer

While in the Shadowcurse, the light is constantly at risk.

When the PCs enter the Shadowcurse, the GM sets a real-life timer for 1d20 + 30 minutes.

When the timer runs out, the Shadowcurse lashes out, extinguishing all the light sources that the PCs have. This timer is hidden from the players.

## Lore

***Scribe's Note***
*The origins of the Shadowcurse are a mystery, it is believed to have begun before **The Dawn**, cursing the lands of Mithrinia since before recorded history. Anywhere in total darkness starts to be consumed by the Shadowcurse. Moonlight and starlight keep the overworld from the curse, but in the underworld the Shadowcurse has taken hold. Inky darkness, unnatural silence, and strange smells pervade areas afflicted with the Shadowcurse.*

*Strange and usually dangerous otherworldly entities called [Daemons](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Daemon.md), Daethri in Elvish, seep in to inhabit the Shadowcursed underworld. Intelligent [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) rule over areas afflicted by the Shadowcurse. Light sources are paramount to [Humanoid](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) survival in the Shadowcurse.*

*The Shadowcurse does not take hold immediately; the lights going out in a village basement won't cause ghouls to crawl out of the ground. But, after enough time in the dark, the Shadowcurse takes hold, and all sorts of unnatural creatures pour in from its dark depths.*
