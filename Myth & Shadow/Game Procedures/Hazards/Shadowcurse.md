# Shadowcurse

The Shadowcurse is a blight on the world of **Mithrinia**.

Areas affected by the Shadowcurse *without a sufficient light source present* are considered deadly for the purposes of [Overland Journeys](../Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md) and [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md).

## Time

While in the Shadowcurse, it is recommended that light tracking uses a [Real Timer](../Exploration/Delving.md#Real%20Timer). Using a timer to track light increases tension at the table. When [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md), if players decide to do something that will multiple [Delve Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round), the GM adjusts the light timer down 6 minutes for each round this longer action takes.

## Lore

*The origins of the Shadowcurse are a mystery, it is believed to have begun before the Dawn Era, cursing the lands of Mithrinia since before recorded history. Anywhere in total darkness starts to be consumed by the Shadowcurse. Moonlight and starlight keep the overworld from the curse, but in the underworld the Shadowcurse has taken hold.*

*Strange and usually dangerous creatures seep in to inhabit the Shadowcursed underworld. They are [Monstrosities](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Monstrosity.md). [Undead](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) and [Unholy Creatures](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Unholy%20Creature.md) also reign in the underworld. Light sources are paramount to overworld creatures being able to survive in areas afflicted by the Shadowcurse.*

*The Shadowcurse does not take hold immediately; the lights going out in a village basement won't cause ghouls to crawl out of the ground. But, after enough time in the dark, the Shadowcurse inevitably takes hold, and all sorts of unnatural creatures pour in from its dark depths.*
