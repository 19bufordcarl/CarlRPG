# Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class (DC) represents the **result** needed for a given [Check](Check.md) to be successful.

## Common DCs

- 10 for easy checks
- 15 for normal checks *(When in doubt, the GM should choose 15)*
- 20 for hard checks
- 25 for extreme checks

## Rare DCs

The GM may define other DCs as they see fit for a given situation.

*Author's Note:*
*The GM should set the DC prior to the roll for a check, and should communicate the DC to the player prior to the roll unless there is a good narrative reason why the player wouldn't have any notion how difficult the task at hand is. A player should be sure the GM has set the DC before rolling to preserve the integrity of the DC.*

*When there is no time pressure, the GM can also use the PCs raw ability score (no roll) to decide whether the PC can do an action for expediency.*

*The randomness of the outcome should not, generally speaking, require the d20 to be a natural one or twenty. This means that a DC 30 check only becomes attainable once a PC has their favored ability with a score of +7.*
