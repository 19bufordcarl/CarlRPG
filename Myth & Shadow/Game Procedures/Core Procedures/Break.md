# Break

A *Break* is a period of roughly 5 minutes.

Little things that take more time than an [Action](Action.md) require a break to do. They are primarily used to track time when [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md). When there is no time pressure, breaks can be taken at will.

Generally, all the PCs take a break together, but they may do different things during that break.

You cannot take a break while in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md).

## Recover

If a PC does nothing but rest during a break, they regain a [Quarter](Half.md) of their [Max HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md#Max%20HP) and all their [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) and [Stamina Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md).
