# Half

Whenever you halve a number, you round down.

If multiple sources halve a number, the number is halved each of those times (halving stacks).

## General Math Rules

### Rounding

Unless otherwise specified, decimal numbers are rounded down (truncated).

- *4.5 = 4*
- *4.1 = 4*
- *4.9 = 4*

## Median

In order to take the median of three numbers, you put them in order and choose the middle value. So we can get the following medians:

1. *Values: 1; 2; 3 Median: 2*
2. *Values: -4; 0; 6 Median: 0*
3. *Values: -2; -1; 0 Median: -1*
