# Action

An *Action* is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md).

As part of your action, you may use any of your [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md).

## Standard Action

The standard actions are:

- **Attack**: Make an [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) or perform a [Maneuver](../Combat/Maneuver.md).
- **Dash**: You double your [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) this [Turn](Turn.md).
- **Defend**: Until your next [Turn](Turn.md), increase your [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by 5 + your [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md).
	- You may increase the [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) of a creature you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with instead.
- **First Aid**: You [Stabilize](../Conditions/Stabilized.md) a [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) ally.
- **Improvise**: Attempt anything else you can imagine!
- **Magic:** [Cast a Spell](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) or use a magic item.
- **Ready**: [Ready](../Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md).
- **Stash**: Swap an item in your [Stash](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md) to your [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md).

## Free Action

Things that require very little time or effort are called a *Free Action*. These can be done at will on your [Turn](Turn.md) within reason. The main example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything.

*Make sure to keep your turn to a reasonable amount of time so everyone gets a fair spotlight!*
