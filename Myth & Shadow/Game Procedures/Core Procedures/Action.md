# Action

An action is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md).

As part of your action, you may use any of your [Equipment](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Equipment.md).

*Unless otherwise specified, an action means a combat action.*

## Combat Action

The standard [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) actions are:

- **Attack**: Make an [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) or perform a [Maneuver](../Combat/Maneuver.md).
- **Dash**: Gain extra [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) equal to your movement speed this [Turn](Turn.md).
- **Defend**: Until your next [Turn](Turn.md), any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) made against you or an ally you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with is automatically a miss if the attacker's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is lower than your [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md).
- **First Aid**: You [Stabilize](../Conditions/Stabilized.md) a [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) ally.
- **Improvise**: Attempt anything you can imagine!
- **Magic:** [Cast a Spell](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) or use a magic item.
- **Ready**: Specify an [Action](Action.md); gain it as a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).

*All combat actions except Ready can be done outside of combat.*

## Delving Action

The main [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md) actions are:

- [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover)
- [Move](../Exploration/Delving.md#Move)

## Free Action

Things that require very little time or effort are called a free action. These can be done at will on your [Turn](Turn.md) within reason. The main example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything.

*Make sure to keep your turn to a reasonable amount of time so everyone gets a fair spotlight!*
