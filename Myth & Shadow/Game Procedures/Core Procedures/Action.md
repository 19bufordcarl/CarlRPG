# Action

An action is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md).

## Combat Action

Unless otherwise specified, [Action](Action.md) means [Combat Action](#Combat%20Action). See [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md).

The standard combat actions are:

- **Attack**: Make an [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) (or perform a [Maneuver](../Combat/Maneuver.md)).
- **Dash**: Gain extra [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) equal to your movement speed this [Turn](Turn.md).
- **Dodge**: Until your next [Turn](Turn.md), attacks made against you automatically miss if the attacker's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is lower than your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).
- **Help**: Attempt to [Stabilize](../Conditions/Stabilized.md) a [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) ally, [DC](DC.md) 15 [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md).
- **Improvise**: Attempt anything else you can imagine!
- **Magic:** [Cast a Spell](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) or use a magic item.
- **Ready**: Specify an [Action](Action.md); gain it as a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).

### Slow Action

A slow action requires you to be stationary on your [Turn](Turn.md). Most [Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md) are a slow action to [Cast](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).

You cannot use a slow action if you have used any [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) on your turn. After using a slow action, you cannot use any [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) for the rest of your turn.

You can only [Ready](../Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) a slow action if you can still use a slow action.

### Free Action

In combat, things that require very little time or effort are called a free action. These can be done at will on your [Turn](Turn.md) within reason. The main example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything.

- Try to keep it to a reasonable amount of time to keep the game moving and let other players have their turn.
- Other examples include dropping what you are holding, dropping concentration, etc.

## Delving Action

Many [Delve Actions](../Exploration/Delving.md#Delve%20Actions) are less standard; exploration is the gameplay. See [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md).

The common delve actions are:

- [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover)
- [Search](../Exploration/Delving.md#Search)
- [Move](../Exploration/Delving.md#Move)

*If the type of action is not specified, assume it is a combat action (6 seconds).*

*Combat actions can be done outside of combat, it is merely shorthand to express their quickness.*
