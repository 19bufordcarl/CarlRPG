# Action

An action is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md).

As part of your action, you may use any item in your [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md).

## Combat Action

Unless otherwise specified, [Action](Action.md) means [Combat Action](#Combat%20Action). See [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md).

The standard combat actions are:

- **Attack**: Make an [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) (or perform a [Maneuver](../Combat/Maneuver.md)).
- **Dash**: Gain extra [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) equal to your movement speed this [Turn](Turn.md).
- **Defend**: Until your next [Turn](Turn.md), any [Attack](../Combat/Attack.md) made against you or an adjacent ally is automatically a miss if the attacker's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is lower than your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).
- **First Aid**: You [Stabilize](../Conditions/Stabilized.md) a [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) ally
- **Improvise**: Attempt anything you can imagine!
- **Magic:** [Cast a Spell](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) or use a magic item.
- **Ready**: Specify an [Action](Action.md); gain it as a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md).

*If the type of action is not specified, assume it is a combat action.*

*All combat actions except Ready can be done outside of combat.*

## Delving Action

Many [Delve Actions](../Exploration/Delving.md#Delve%20Actions) are less standard; exploration is the gameplay â€” *See [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md)*.

The main delve actions are:

- [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover)
- [Move](../Exploration/Delving.md#Move)

## Free Action

Things that require very little time or effort are called a free action. These can be done at will on your [Turn](Turn.md) within reason. The main example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything.

Try to keep these to a reasonable amount of time to keep the game moving and let other players have their turn.
