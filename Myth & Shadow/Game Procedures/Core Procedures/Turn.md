# Turn

A *Turn* is simply one player's turn to act in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md).

On a turn you may perform an [Action](Action.md) and [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md).

Your ability to perform a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) this [Round](Round.md) is refreshed at the start of your turn.

When all PCs and NPCs have taken a turn, the [Round](Round.md) ends and the next round starts.

On a *Fast Turn*, a PC may only perform one of their [Action](Action.md) and [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md), not both. Also, the PC may not [Ready](../Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) an [Action](Action.md).
