# Turn

A "turn" is simply one players turn to act. On a turn you may perform an [Action](Core%20Procedures/Action.md) and [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md). Your ability to perform a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) this [Round](Core%20Procedures/Round.md) is also refreshed at the start of your turn.

When all PCs and NPCs have taken their turn, the [Round](Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends and the next round starts.

## Combat Turn

In [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), turns last 6 seconds and have relatively strict rules for what you can do.

Unless otherwise specified, 1 turn means 1 combat turn.

## Delve Turn

When [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md), a turn last 6 minutes and actions have much more lee way. By default, these turns are measured in real time by the GM with a timer.

## Free Actions

In combat, things that require very little time or effort are called a free action. These can be done at will on your turn within reason. The main example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything.

- Try to keep it to a reasonable amount of time to keep the game moving and let other players have their turn.
- Other examples include dropping what you are holding, dropping concentration, etc.
