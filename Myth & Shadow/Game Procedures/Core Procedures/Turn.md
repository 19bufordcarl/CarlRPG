# Turn

A *Turn* is simply one player's turn to act. On a turn you may perform an [Action](Action.md) and [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md).

Your ability to perform a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) this [Round](Round.md) is refreshed at the start of your turn.

When all PCs and NPCs have taken a turn, the [Round](Round.md) ends and the next round starts.

*Unless otherwise specified, a turn means a combat turn.*

## Combat Turn

In [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), a turn lasts roughly 6 seconds.

### Fast Turn

A PC that takes a *Fast Turn* acts before the hostiles in combat.

On a *Fast Turn*, a PC may only perform one of their [Action](Action.md) and [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md), not both.

## Delve Turn

When [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md), a turn lasts roughly 6 minutes.
