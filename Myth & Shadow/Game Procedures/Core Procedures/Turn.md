# Turn

A "turn" is simply one players turn to act. On a turn you may perform an [Action](Core%20Procedures/Action.md) and [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md). Your ability to perform a [Reaction](../Combat/Reaction.md) this [Round](Core%20Procedures/Round.md) is also refreshed at the start of your turn.

When all PCs and NPCs have taken their turn, the [Round](Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends and the next round starts.

## Combat Turn

In [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), turns last 6 seconds and have relatively strict rules for what you can do.

Unless otherwise specified, 1 turn means 1 combat turn.

## Delve Turn

When [Delving](../Exploration/Delving.md), a turn last 6 minutes and actions have much more lee way. By default, these turns are measured in real time by the GM with a timer.
