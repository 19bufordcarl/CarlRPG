# Geometry

There are 3 mains way to handle geometry in game for Myth & Shadow. See this [article](https://slyflourish.com/the_abstract_battlemap.html) for an explanation of how to handle different types of geometry at the table.

## Measurement

*Default*
Choose a scale (typically 1 inch real space = 5 feet in game). Get some miniatures and battle maps (or use a VTT with a ruler) and measure the specified distances.

## Gridded

*Optional*
Like measurement, except you play on a grid of 1 inch squares (5 foot squares in game).

## Abstract

*Optional*
Break the map down into abstract concepts. Typically 30 foot zones are used. See Shadowdark for an example of how to do that.

# Sizes

Creatures occupy a space equal to their size as determined by the number of squares they would occupy on a grid.

| Size       | Grid Equivalent  | Measurement | Example |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Tiny       | None             | None        | Mouse   |
| Small      | ~Half a Square   | 3 feet      | Child   |
| Normal     | One square       | 5 feet      | Human   |
| Large      | 2x2 square area  | 10 feet     | Bear    |
| Huge       | 3x3 square area  | 15 feet     | T Rex   |
| Gargantuan | 4x4+ square area | 20+ feet    | Dragon+ |
