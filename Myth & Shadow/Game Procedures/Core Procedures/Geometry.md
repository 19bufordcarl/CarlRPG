# Geometry

Choose a scale (usually 1 inch real space = 5 feet in game). Get some miniatures and battle maps (or use a VTT with a ruler) and measure the specified distances.

## Gridded

Like measurement, except you play on a square grid (usually 1 inch to 5 foot squares in game).

*Optional*
Use an abstract representation, like [Zone Based Maps](Zone%20Based%20Maps.md).
