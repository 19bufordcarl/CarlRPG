# Zone Based Maps

*Optional*
Zone based maps are the recommended way to implement abstract [Geometry](Geometry.md).



## GM Motivation

Zone based maps require more rules text to accurately define, but they tend to prove much faster and easier to run in both VTTs and at a physical table once you get the hang of it, particularly for the GM. This is an example of an interesting phenomena in problem solving â€” problems which are easy to specify are often incredibly difficult to solve. See [Collatz Conjecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)

A measurement system is the easiest to specify for TTRPGs, and so the vast majority use it. But when you think about it, this is a very hard system to implement.

The method is essentially:

> *Create a scale model of the fictional game world and characters. Using the scale for this world, convert the distances given in feet to measurements for your scale model.*

The phrase "*Create a scale model*" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. That heavy lifting gets passed down to the GM, who now needs to spend significant time creating that scale model, whether it is digital VTT maps or physical maps.

Instead, you as the GM can opt to use the rules for Zone Based Maps. By enduring a little bit more rules text upfront, you can save yourself lots of time spent making scale models.
