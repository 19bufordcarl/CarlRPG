# Resting

*Resting* is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest

If the PCs are in a safe space, they can [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) as much as they want to regain all their [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) without needing to roll dice. This takes between 30 minutes and an hour.

## Long Rest

A PC can only benefit from a long rest once per day. A long rest is usually between 5 to 8 hours. A long rest confers the following benefits:

- A PC restores all their [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md).
- A PC removes the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
- A PC avoids the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).

A rotation of 3 PCs can stand guard over a long rest â€” first, middle, and last watch.

### Interruption

If a long rest is interrupted, an [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) PC makes a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [Check](Check.md). On a failure, they remain [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) and do not restore any [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md).
