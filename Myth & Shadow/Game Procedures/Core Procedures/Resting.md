# Resting

*Resting* is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest

If the PCs are in a safe space, they take as many [Breaks](Break.md) as they want to regain all their [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md), [SP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), and [MP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) automatically. This takes roughly an hour.

## Long Rest

A PC can only benefit from a long rest once per day. A long rest takes several hours. A long rest confers the following benefits:

- A PC restores all their [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md), [SP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), and [MP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md).
- A PC removes the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
- A PC avoids the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).

A rotation of 3 PCs can stand guard over a long rest â€” first, middle, and last watch.

### Interruption

If a long rest is interrupted, an [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) PC remains [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) and does not restore any [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md).
