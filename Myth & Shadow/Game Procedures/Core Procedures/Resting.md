# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest

If the PCs are in a safe space, they can [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) as much as they want to regain all their [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) without needing to roll dice. This takes between 30 minutes and an hour.

### Interruption

If a short rest is interrupted by [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) or similar, the PCs regain 1d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) for every [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round) that past prior to the interruption.

## Long Rest

A long rest consumes 1 ration, and a PC can only benefit from a long rest once per day. A long rest is usually between 5 to 8 hours. A long rest confers the following benefits:

- A PC restores all their [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md).
- A PC removes the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
- A PC avoids the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).

A rotation of 3 PCs is required to stand guard over a long rest â€” first watch, middle watch, and last watch.

### Interruption

If a long rest is interrupted by [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) or otherwise, a PC makes a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [Check](Check.md). On a failure, the PC does not remove the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

==***Word to the wise:*** Don't count on long resting outside of civilization.==
