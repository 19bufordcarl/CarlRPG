# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest

If the PCs are in a safe space, they can take some time to [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) as much as they want, and regain all [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) after about 30 minutes to an hour usually.

### Interruption

If a short rest is interrupted, the PCs regain [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) as if they had been using [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover).
*(1d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)) per [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round) in the short rest prior to interruption.*

## Long Rest

A long rest consumes 1 ration, and a PC can only benefit from a long rest once per day. A long rest must be at least 6 hours. A long rest confers all the benefits of a short rest. Additionally a long rest confers the following benefits:

- Remove the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
- Avoid the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).
- Restore any *temporary* ability damage.

A rotation of 3 PCs is required to stand guard over a long rest (first watch, middle watch, and last watch). PCs that stand guard do not restore damaged ability scores.

PCs cannot do heavy mental activity like [Magic](../../Magic/Spells.md) during a long rest.

### Interruption

If a long rest is interrupted by [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) or similar danger, a PC must make a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check to receive the benefits of the rest. On a failed check, they PC only receives the benefits of a short rest, and avoids the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).

==***Word to the wise:*** Don't count on long resting outside of civilization.==
