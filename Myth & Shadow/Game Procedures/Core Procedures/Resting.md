# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest

A short rest is a period of 1 hour (10 [Delve Rounds](Round.md#Delve%20Round)) doing next to no movement or physical activity. PCs regain all [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) after a short rest.

### Interruption

If a short rest is interrupted, the PCs regain [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) as if they had been using [Recover](../Exploration/Delving.md#Recover).
*(d4 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)) for each [Delve Round](Round.md#Delve%20Round) in the short rest prior to interruption.*

## Long Rest

A long rest consumes 1 ration and must be at least 9 hours (3 [Watches](../Exploration/Watches.md)) long. A long rest confers all the benefits of a short rest. Additionally a long rest confers the following benefits:

- Remove the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
- Avoid the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).
- Restore any *temporary* ability damage.

PCs can do heavy mental activity like [Magic](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spells.md) for at most 1 hour during a long rest.

PCs spend at most one [Watch](../Exploration/Watches.md) per long rest standing guard.

A PC can benefit from at most 1 long rest per day.

### Interruption

If a long rest is interrupted by [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md) or similar danger, a PC must make a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check to receive the benefits of the rest. On a failed check, they PC only receives the benefits of a short rest, and avoids the effects of [Sleep Derivation](../Hazards/Biological%20Hazards.md#Sleep%20Derivation).

For heavy mental activity, a PC must stop whatever it was doing to engage in combat.

- They suffer a [Critical Miscast](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) if the activity involved [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
- Any damage they take **forces** them to stop activity and thus suffer a [Critical Miscast](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).

==***Word to the wise:*** Don't count on long resting outside of civilization.==
