# Zone

A *Zone* is an abstract representation of distance. Typically in [Combat](../Combat/Combat.md), a *Zone* is roughly 30 feet, but this may vary depending on the situation. What's more important than the precise measurement is that the *Zone* represents a distinct location in the world.[^1]

Each *Zone* is given a name to describe it. The GM communicates which zones are adjacent to one another. There are many ways to represent zones. The default method is detailed below.

## Zone Based Map Procedure

1. The GM finds a reference image for, or simply imagines, the environment.
2. The GM draws or outlines all the zones in the immediate area and gives them a name.
	1. They may add more later if the need arises.
3. The GM denotes the connections between adjacent zones by connecting them.

Depending on whether you are playing physically or virtually:

1. **Physical Tabletop**: Sketch out the zones on battle mat, sheet of paper, or similar.
2. **Virtual Tabletop**: Overlay rectangles on the map and give each zone a name.

## Rules for Zones

1. A creature can use 1 *Zone* of [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) to move anywhere within their current zone or an adjacent zone. They may choose to become [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with any creature in those zones.
	1. If that creature is [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with other creatures, the creature who is spending their [Movement](../Combat/Movement.md) chooses any number of those creatures to be [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with.
	2. *Tip: Use miniature figures to represent creatures. This can be helpful to track when many creatures are engaged with each other in a large melee*.
2. A [Ranged Attack](../Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md) can target anyone they can see in the same zone or a number of zones away according to the range of the weapon.

Whenever 5 feet is referenced, treat it as meaning [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md).

[^1]: *A large outdoor archery battle may have 300 foot zones, while a cramped dungeon only has 30 foot zones.*
