# Check

A *Check* is used to resolve an uncertain situation. *Also known as a "d20 roll" or "roll"*.

To make a check, roll a d20 and then add the appropriate bonuses to get the **result**.

Typically, a check is made with an [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) as a bonus.

If the relevant [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), you also add your expertise die as a bonus.

## Check Resolution

The check is successful if the **result** equals or exceeds the difficulty class ([DC](DC.md)) for this check.

Otherwise, the check is considered a failure.

*A creature can choose to automatically fail a check if it so desires.*

## Critical Rolls

A result of 20 (natural 20) is a [Critical Success](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md).

A result of 1 (natural 1) is a [Critical Failure](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).
