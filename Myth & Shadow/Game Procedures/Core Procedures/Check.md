# Check

A check is used to resolve an uncertain situation. (Also known as a "d20 roll" or "roll").

To make a check, roll a d20 and then add the relevant [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) as a bonus (also called a modifier) to get the **result**. If it is your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md), also add your expertise die.

## Check Resolution

The check is successful if the **result** meets or exceeds the difficulty class ([DC](DC.md)) for this check. Otherwise, the check is considered a failure.

## Contested Check

A contested check is made by doing the following:

The active creature makes an ability [Check](), with a [DC](DC.md) equal to the target's ability [Check]().

## Critical Rolls

A result of 20 (natural 20) is a [Critical Success](Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md).

A result of 1 (natural 1) is a [Critical Failure](Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).
