# Combat

When a fight breaks out, or seconds start to matter (collapsing cave), [Combat Rounds](Round.md#Combat%20Round) start.

First the GM determines if any creatures are [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md).

The GM then calls for [Initiative](Initiative.md) rolls. [Combat Rounds](Round.md#Combat%20Round) persist until the danger of combat is over, usually from surrender, fleeing, or death.
