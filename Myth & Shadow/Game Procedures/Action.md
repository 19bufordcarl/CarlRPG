# Action

An action is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md).

## Combat Action

Unless otherwise specified, an action means a combat action. They take 6 seconds.

The standard [Combat](Combat.md) actions are

- **Attack**: Make an [Attack](Attack.md)
- **Casting**: [Cast a Spell](../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md)
	- *By default, this is a [Slow Action](Action.md#Slow%20Action)*
- **Dash**: Gain extra [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](Turn.md)
- **Dodge**: You may add your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) to your [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md)
	- *If an attacker fails their attack roll, they cannot [Melee Bash](Reaction.md#Melee%20Bash) you this turn either*
	- *[Ranged Attack](Ranged%20Attack.md) rolls less than 10 + [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) outright miss you*
- **Help**: [Stabilize](../Conditions/Stabilized.md) a [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md#While%20Dying) ally
- **Improvise**: Attempt anything you can imagine!
- **Maneuver:** Perform a [Maneuver](Maneuver.md)
- **Ready**: Specify an action to gain it as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md)
- **Use**: Use a magic item like an enchantment or potion

### Slow Action

To do a slow action, you must spend your [Action](Action.md), [Reaction](Reaction.md), *and* [Movement](Movement.md) **on your [Turn](Turn.md).**

- *This means that slow actions cannot be readied*

## Delving Action

Many [Delve Actions](Delving.md#Primary%20Delve%20Actions) are less standard; exploration and roleplay is the gameplay. These take 6 minutes.

The three main delve actions are

- [Recover](Delving.md#Recover)
- [Searching](Delving.md#Searching)
- [Delve Movement (Double Move)](Delving.md#Delve%20Movement)

*If the type of action is not specified, assume it is a combat action (6 seconds).*

*Combat actions can be done outside of combat, it is merely shorthand to express their quickness.*
