# Action

An action is the main component of a [Turn](Turn.md).

## Combat Action

Unless otherwise specified, an action means a combat action. They take 6 seconds.

The standard [Combat](Combat.md) actions are:

- **Attack**: Make an [Attack](Attack.md) (or perform a [Maneuver](Maneuver.md))
- **Dash**: Gain extra [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your movement speed this [Turn](Turn.md)
- **Dodge**: You may add your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) to your [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md)
- **Help**: Attempt to [Stabilize](../Conditions/Stabilized.md) a [Dying](../Conditions/Dying.md) ally with a [DC](DC.md) [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](Check.md)
- **Improvise**: Attempt anything you can imagine!
- **Magic:** [Cast a Spell](../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) or use a magic item like an [Enchantment](../Magic/Enchanting/Enchantment%20Rules.md) or [Potion](../Magic/Alchemy/Potion%20Rules.md).
- **Ready**: Specify an action to gain it as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](Turn.md)

### Slow Action

A slow action is a restricted type of combat action. Most [Spells](../Magic/Spellcasting/Spells.md) are a slow action to [Cast](../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).

A slow action can only be used if you do not use **any** [Movement](Movement.md) during that [Turn](Turn.md).

## Delving Action

Many [Delve Actions](Delving.md#Primary%20Delve%20Actions) are less standard; exploration and roleplay is the gameplay. They take 6 minutes.

The three main delve actions are

- [Recover](Delving.md#Recover)
- [Searching](Delving.md#Searching)
- [Delve Movement (Double Move)](Delving.md#Delve%20Movement)

*If the type of action is not specified, assume it is a combat action (6 seconds).*

*Combat actions can be done outside of combat, it is merely shorthand to express their quickness.*
