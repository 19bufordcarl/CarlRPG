# Movement

On a [Turn](Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your speed, the default is 30 feet. Movement can be discontinuous, meaning you can move 10 feet, [Attack](Attack.md), pick up a shield, move 15 feet.

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](Action.md) to gain [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](Turn.md).

## Movement Minor Actions

You can spend 5 feet of movement to either:

- Stand up from [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md)
- Interact with large items (around the size of a standard [Shield](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Mundane%20Armors/Mundane%20Shield.md))

*If playing with abstract distance, these are 'free' to do (within reason).*

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:
- Difficult Terrain
- Crawling
- Sneaking
- Wading
- Swimming

- Climbing

## Sizes

Creatures occupy a space equal to their size (number of squares they occupy on a grid). Normal size is 1 square (5'). Small is less than 1 square. Large is 2x2 squares. Huge is 3x3 squares. Gargantuan is anything 4x4 squares or bigger.

## Enemy Creatures

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), you may move through its space. (You can always attempt a [Maneuver](Maneuver.md) to do the otherwise impossible!)

For creatures 2 sizes larger than you, (3x3 squares or more for normal size) you move through their space with [Difficult Movement](Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](Turn.md) in their occupied space, you must make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) with a [DC](DC.md) equal to 10 + their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) as they nearly crush you.

## Variable Speed

PCs have a base move speed of 30'.

If a PC is not wearing [Heavy Armor](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md), increase their speed by 5' times their [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Halved](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving).
*If playing with [Abstract Geometry](../Magic/Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/{AOE}%20Area%20of%20Effect.md#Abstract%20Geometry), then a PC has a speed of 60' if they have 5 or more [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).*

### NPC Variable Speed

For the GM, an NPC's speed is simply what it is defined to be in their stat block.
