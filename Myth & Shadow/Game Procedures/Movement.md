# Movement

On a [Turn](Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your movement (speed), the default is 30'.

- On a grid, a one inch (1") square is usually five feet (5'), so this would be six (6) squares.
- Grid-less, a one inch (1") square is usually five feet (5') also, so this would be six inches (6").
	- With abstract distance, operate in chunks of roughly 6" or whatever you define that standard unit to be for you (a banana, a pen, a phone, etc.)

Movement can be discontinuous, (i.e. move 10', [Attack](Attack.md), open door, move 15').

## Movement Minor Actions

You can spend 5' of movement to perform minor actions. The most used examples being:

- Stand up
- Open a door
- Lie down
- Pull a lever
- Pick up an item

*If playing with abstract distance, these are 'free' to do (within reason).*

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:

- Crawling
- Sneaking
- Wading
- Swimming
- Difficult Terrain
- Climbing

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](Action.md) to gain [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](Turn.md).

- (So 30' would become 60', 35' becomes 70', etc.)

## Enemy Creatures

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), you may move through its space. (You can always attempt a [Maneuver](Maneuver.md) to do the otherwise impossible!)

## Sizes

Creatures occupy a space equal to their size (number of squares they occupy on a grid). Normal size is 1 square (5'). For creatures 2 sizes larger than you, (3x3 squares or more for normal size) you move through their space with [Difficult Movement](Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement).

If you end your [Turn](Turn.md) in their occupied space, you must make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) with a [DC](DC.md) equal to 10 + their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) as they nearly crush you.

## Variable Speed

*Optional Rule: Recommended if playing on a grid*
- PCs have a base move speed of 30'.
- If a PC is not wearing [Heavy Armor](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md):
	- Increase a PCs speed by 5' a number of times equal to their [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Halved](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving).
- If playing with [Abstract](../Magic/Spells/Area%20of%20Effect.md#Abstract) distance, then a PC has a speed of 60' if they have 5 or more [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

A creature's speed is defined by their stat block and may or may not follow this rule. If unspecified, use 30' + (5' x the creature's [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) if positive and not heavily armored).
