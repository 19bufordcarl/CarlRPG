# Movement

On a [Turn](Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your speed, the default is 30 feet. Movement can be discontinuous, meaning you can move 10 feet, [Attack](Attack.md), pick up a shield, move 15 feet. You can move through allies freely.

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](Action.md) to gain [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](Turn.md).

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include: Difficult Terrain, crawling, sneaking, wading, swimming, climbing.

## Movement Minor Actions

You can spend 5 feet of movement to either:

- Stand up from [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md)
- Interact with large items (around the size of a standard [Shield](../Items/Armor/Mundane%20Armor/Mundane%20Shield.md))

*If playing with abstract distance, these are 'free' to do (within reason).*

## Movement Through Enemies

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), you may move through its space.

For creatures 2 [Sizes](Geometry.md#Sizes) larger than you, you can move through their space with [Difficult Movement](Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](Turn.md) in their space, you must make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) with a [DC](DC.md) equal to 10 + their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) and fall [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) as they nearly crush you.

## Variable Speed

*Optional Rule*
PCs have a base move speed of 30 feet.

If a PC is not wearing [Heavy Armor](../Items/Armor/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md), increase their speed by 5 feet times their [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Halved](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving).

If playing with [Abstract](Geometry.md#Abstract) geometry, then a PC has a speed of 60 feet if they have at least 5 [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

### NPC Variable Speed

For the GM, an NPC's speed is simply what it is defined to be in their stat block.
