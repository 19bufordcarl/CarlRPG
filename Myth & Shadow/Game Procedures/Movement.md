# Movement

On a [Turn](Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your movement (speed), the default is 30’. 
- On a grid, each square is usually 5', so this would be 6 squares.
- In a measurement system 5' is usually 1" in real space, so this would be 6".
- FYI (feet = ', inches = ")

Movement can be discontinuous, (i.e. move 10', [Attack](Attack.md), drink potion, move 15').
## Movement Minor Actions
You can spend 5' of movement to perform minor actions. The most used examples being:
- Drink a potion (max of 1 potion per [Round](Round.md))
- Stand up
- Open a door
- Lie down
- Pull a lever
- Pick up an item
## Difficult Movement
Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:
- Crawling
- Sneaking
- Wading
- Swimming
- Difficult Terrain
- Climbing
## Dash
You can spend an [Action](Action.md) to gain [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](Turn.md). 
- (So 30' would become 60').
## Opportunity Attacks
If you are [Threatened](../Conditions/Threatened.md) by a creature, moving out of that creature’s threaten range allows that creature to use its [Reaction](Reaction.md) to make a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md) against you.
- These [Melee Attacks](Melee%20Attack.md) are called opportunity attacks.

You can use your [Reaction](Reaction.md) to avoid one opportunity attack.
## Enemy Creatures
You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) you may move through its space.
## Sizes
Creatures occupy a space equal to their size. Normal size is 1 square or 5 feet. For creatures 2 sizes larger than you, (3 squares or more for normal size) you move through their space with [Difficult Movement](Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](Turn.md) in their occupied space, they may use their [Reaction](Reaction.md) to make an [Opportunity Attack](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks) against you.
## Variable Speed
*Optional Rule: Recommended if playing on a grid*
- PCs have a base move speed of 30'.
- If a PC is not wearing [Heavy Armor](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md):
	- Increase a PCs speed by 5' a number of times equal to their [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Halved](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving).

A creature's speed is defined by their stat block and may or may not follow this rule. If unspecified, use 30' + (5' x the creature's [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) if positive and not heavily armored).

*Good for gamers who enjoy the nitty gritty of positioning tactics on battle maps.*
