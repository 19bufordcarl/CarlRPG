# Critical Miscast

When your [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) [Check](../Check.md) is a [Critical Failure](Critical%20Failure.md), you miscast the spell. 

If you cast the spell with Mythril, the spell backfires in some unexpected, usually bad, way. 
	Consult the [Mythril Miscast Tables](../../Magic/Miscast%20Tables/!Mythril%20Miscast%20Tables.md).

If you cast the spell granted by your [Patron](../../Magic/Spells/Patrons/Patron.md), they are displeased and revoke your ability to cast that spell until you complete a penance ritual. Your [Patron](../../Magic/Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) specifies the exact nature of penance, but the default is a sacrifice of precious metals / gems from the PC according to the table below. 
## Penance Sacrifice Value

| Spell Level | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1           | 50    |
| 2           | 200   |
| 3           | 400   |
| 4           | 900   |
| 5           | 1500  |

Inadequate or subversive penance, like having a party member steal back your sacrifice from the altar, displeases your [Patron](../../Magic/Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) further and the spell loss becomes permanent.
