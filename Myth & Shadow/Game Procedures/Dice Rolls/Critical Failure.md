# Critical Failure

A [Check](../Check.md) result of 1 (natural 1) is a [Critical Failure](Critical%20Failure.md). It is always a failure no matter what. And in certain cases it results in some extra detrimental effect, like a [Critical Miscast](Critical%20Miscast.md).

## Luck

After rolling a natural 1, the cosmic tides of fate and balance have good fortune in store for you. You gain a [Reroll Token](Reroll%20Tokens.md).
