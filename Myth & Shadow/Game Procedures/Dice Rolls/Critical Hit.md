# Critical Hit

When making a [Melee](../Melee%20Attack.md) or [Ranged Attack](../Ranged%20Attack.md), if you rolled a [Critical Success](Critical%20Success.md), you can do a critical hit.

A critical hit lets you double the damage dealt from each [Damage Type](../../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) on that attack.

Maths Note
- While each damage type is doubled separately, this is relevant only for the purposes of the [Resistant](../../Conditions/Resistant.md), [Vulnerable](../../Conditions/Vulnerable.md), or [Immune](../../Conditions/Immune.md) conditions.
- If none of those apply, the distributive property means that you can just get the total damage and double that.
