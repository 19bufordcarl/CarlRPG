# Reroll Tokens (Luck)
Reroll Tokens are way to represent that the PCs are the main characters of the story and they are inherently lucky. Main characters can have a *little* plot armor, *"cats can have a little salami"*.
## Gaining Reroll Tokens
***A PC may only have 1 reroll token at a time.***

After a PC rolls a [Critical Failure](Critical%20Failure.md), they may gain a Reroll Token. *It cannot be used for that roll.*

Certain special abilities or magic may grant the PC a Reroll Token. 
- See [Lucky](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Human.md#Lucky) and [Luck](../../Magic/Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/Luck.md).
## Spending Reroll Tokens 
A PC can spend a Reroll Token to reroll any die roll that *they* made. The new result must be used.

You **cannot** use these to reroll another player's die rolls, or the GM's die rolls, your rolls only.

Any unspent Reroll Tokens at the end of a session expire, they do not carry over.
