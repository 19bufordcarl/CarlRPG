# Reroll Tokens

A PC can spend a Reroll Token to reroll any [Check](../Check.md) (it can be another creature's roll) and the new result is used.

A PC can only have 1 reroll token at a time.

Reroll tokens are only given out through special abilities, typically through a [Deity's](../../Magic/Spells/Deities/Deities.md) blessing.

*The [Deities](../../Magic/Spells/Deities/Deities.md) of the world are fickle. Their existence isn't disputed, though the degree of their influence on the mortal realm is heavily debated. Most scholars believe it to be negligible, and couched mostly in superstition.*
