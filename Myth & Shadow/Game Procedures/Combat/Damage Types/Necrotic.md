# Necrotic

Necrotic damage represents damage that disrupts the complex life force of mortals directly. It takes the forms of poison, disease, and other [Death](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) magic. These are the [Necro](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain; they facilitate the destruction of one's life force. This is the most frightening magic to most mortals, it is championed by the dreaded necromancers.
