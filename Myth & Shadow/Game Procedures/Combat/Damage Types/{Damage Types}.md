# Damage Types

Damage normally has damage type that affects how it is applied to targets.

If no damage type is specified, then the HP of the target is simply reduced, bypassing [Resistant](../../Conditions/Resistant.md), [Vulnerable](../../Conditions/Vulnerable.md), and [Immune](../../Conditions/Immune.md).
