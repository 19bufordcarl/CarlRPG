# Ranged Attack

One of the [Attack](Attack.md) types.

To make a *Ranged Attack*, make a [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die and add [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

## Line of Sight and Cover Rules

If the target is behind cover that poses a large obstruction, you attack with [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

You can only make ranged attacks against targets that you can see.

*The GM should let the PCs know when a creature is obstructed if it makes sense.*

## Improvised Ranged Weapons

Improvised ranged weapons are not very aerodynamic. They deal [Mundane Damage](Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md). You *may* use [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) instead of [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) for the attack and damage rolls. Improvised ranged weapons have a normal range of 30' and a max range of 60'.

If the improvised weapon is a [Melee Weapon](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Melee%20Property.md) without the [Thrown Property](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Thrown%20Property.md), you may add the damage die for the weapon if you beat the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by 10 or more.
