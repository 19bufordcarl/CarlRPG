# Ranged Attack

To make a *Ranged Attack*, make a [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

Every *Ranged Attack* has a specified range. You can only attack targets you can see within range.

You may choose to attack with [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) to increase your range by 1 [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die plus [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

## Line of Sight and Cover Rules

If the target is behind cover that poses a large obstruction, you attack with [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

*The GM should let the PCs know what in the environment, if anything, grants obstruction.*

## Improvised Ranged Weapons

Improvised ranged weapons deal [Mundane Damage](Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

You may use [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) instead of [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) for the attack and damage rolls.

Improvised ranged weapons have a range of 0 [Zones](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).
