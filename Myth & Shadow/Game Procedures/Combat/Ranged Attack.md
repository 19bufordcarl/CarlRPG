# Ranged Attack

To make a *Ranged Attack*, make a [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Ranged Combat](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Ranged%20Combat.md)) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

Every *Ranged Attack* has a specified range. You can only attack targets you can see within range.

You may choose to attack with [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) to increase your range by 1 [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die plus your [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md). If you are proficient in [Ranged Combat](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Ranged%20Combat.md), you may choose to [Power Attack](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Power%20Attack.md) or regain [Stamina Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

## Line of Sight and Cover Rules

If the target is behind cover that poses a large obstruction, you attack with [Disadvantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md).

*The GM should let the PCs know what in the environment, if anything, grants obstruction.*

## Improvised Ranged Weapons

An improvised ranged weapon is typically throwing anything besides classical [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md). E.g. a chair, a bottle, fists, etc. Treat these as a weapon that has a 1d3 [Tier 1](Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage die.

Improvised ranged weapons have a range of 0 [Zones](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).
