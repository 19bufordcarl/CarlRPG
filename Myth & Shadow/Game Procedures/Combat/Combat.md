# Combat

When danger breaks out, [Combat Rounds](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round) start.

Before [Initiative](Initiative.md), the GM determines if any creatures are [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md).

The [Initiative](Initiative.md) procedure governs combat.

## Geometry

The environment for combat is broken out into [Zones](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).
