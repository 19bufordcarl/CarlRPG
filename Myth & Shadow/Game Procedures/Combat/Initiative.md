# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) order for the [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## Initiative Procedure

1. Determine *Initiative* order for all PCs and NPCs.
	1. A PC rolls a d20 and adds their [Initiative Bonus](Initiative.md#Initiative%20Bonus) to determine their *Initiative*.
	2. An NPC's *Initiative* is 10 + their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
2. Start with the highest *Initiative*, that creature gets their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
3. Proceed to the next highest *Initiative*, that creature gets their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
	1. Repeat this step until all creatures have taken a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
	2. Then this [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends and the next [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) starts. Go back to step 2.
4. Once the danger subsides, combat ends.

*In case of a tie, the player closest to the left of the GM goes first. PCs win ties against NPCs.*

## Initiative Bonus

A PCs *Initiative Bonus* is equal to the [Median](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of their [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). You do not add your [Expertise Die](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md#Expertise%20Die) to this bonus.
