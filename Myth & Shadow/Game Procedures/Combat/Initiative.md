# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) order for the [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).
*Order means descending order for the purposes of initiative.*

## Initiative Procedure

1. All PCs roll a d20 and add their [Initiative Bonus](Initiative.md#Initiative%20Bonus) to determine their *Initiative*.
	1. An NPCs is simply 10 + their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
2. Starting with the highest *Initiative*, each combatant takes their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in *Initiative* order.
3. Once all combatant's have taken their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you go back to the highest *Initiative* and the next [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) begins. Repeat until combat ends.

If a creature wishes to wait to do something, they can use the [Ready Action](Reaction.md#Ready).

## Initiative Bonus

A PCs *Initiative Bonus* is equal to the [Median](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of their [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). You do not add your [Expertise Die](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md#Expertise%20Die) to this bonus.
