# Initiative

When a [Combat](Combat.md) encounter begins, you need to determine [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) order for the [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## Initiative Procedure

1. Any PCs that want to take a [Fast Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md#Fast%20Turn) go first.
2. Next, GM has all the NPCs take their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
3. Any PCs that want to take a normal [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) go after.
4. Any [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md) creatures go last.

At the end of this procedure, the [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) ends and the next [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md) starts back at step 1.

*PCs may change the type of turn they take every round.*

## Ties

The PCs may decide their [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) order amongst themselves, or simply pass play to the left.

The GM decides the NPC's [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) order.
