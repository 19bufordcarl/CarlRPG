The following circumstances let creature's make an opportunity attack:

- A creature you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with attempts to make a [Ranged Attack](Ranged%20Attack.md).
- A creature you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with attempts [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).
	- Unless the [Spell](../../Magic/Spells.md) has a [Spell Range](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Attributes.md#Spell%20Range) of *Touch* and you are the target of that spell.
