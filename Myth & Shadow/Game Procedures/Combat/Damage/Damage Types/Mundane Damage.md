# Mundane Damage

Mundane damage is the catch all default damage type for anything non-magical that does not fit into one of the other damage types.

Items with the [Mundane Property](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Material%20Properties/Mundane%20Property.md) deal Mundane damage, as do natural attacks like a bear's claws or a snake's bite.
