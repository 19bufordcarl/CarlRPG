# Tier 2

Tier 2 damage is the middle [Damage Tier]({Damage%20Tiers}.md). This represents solid magical damage. It is somewhat difficult to be [Resistant](../../../Conditions/Resistant.md) to and somewhat rare to encounter.

Generally, this tier is found at [Levels](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) 4-7.
