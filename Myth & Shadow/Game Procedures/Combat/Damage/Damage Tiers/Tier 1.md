# Tier 1

Tier 1 damage is the lowest [Damage Tier]({Damage%20Tiers}.md). This represents the weakest and most mundane damage. It is the easiest to be [Resistant](../../../Conditions/Resistant.md) to of the tiers and the most common to encounter.

Generally, this tier is found at [Levels](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) 1-3.

If a [Spell](../../../../Magic/Spells.md) does tier 1 damage and is upcast to a higher [Spell Level](../../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Level.md), it deals [Tier 2](Tier%202.md) damage instead.

Unless otherwise specified, you cannot upcast a spell to do [Tier 3](Tier%203.md) damage.
