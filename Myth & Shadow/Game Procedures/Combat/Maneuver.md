# Maneuver

A maneuver is an special type of [Attack](Attack.md). The effect of a maneuver is not defined. Instead, the attacker proposes an effect when they make the attack. The target of the attack chooses whether to suffer the effect *OR* suffer the damage of the attack.

The effect may include damage, [Conditions](../Conditions/{Conditions}.md), or anything else, so long as it is believable.

## FAQ

- If a maneuver is deemed impossible by the GM, the target just takes the damage.
	- *No giving skeletons billions of gold coins.*
- Maneuver effects can use items that are not part of the actual [Attack](Attack.md).
	- *Shackling an enemy is a great example of this!*
- The GM should adjudicate the NPCs choice of effect as if they were that NPC.
	- *Dying sucks. Getting [Restrained](../Conditions/Restrained.md) is better than almost dying.*
- If using a skill to force a check, the player needs to have a good narrative explanation of how they are going to effectively perform this maneuver for it to work.
