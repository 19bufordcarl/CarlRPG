# Maneuver

A maneuver is an special type of [Attack](Attack.md).

To perform a maneuver:

1. The attacker proposes an effect when they make the attack.
2. They still make the [Attack](Attack.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) as normal as well as roll damage.
3. The GM interprets the amount of damage dealt as the degree of success for the maneuver.
	1. If the maneuver fails, the player may have the target take [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the damage rolled.

The effect may include damage, [Conditions](../Conditions/{Conditions}.md), or anything else that is plausible.

## FAQ

	- *Shackling an enemy is a great example of this!*
- The player and GM should resolve maneuvers in a reasonable amount of time.
	- *Make sure the other players are getting time too, and that the game pace stays moving.*
