# Maneuver

A maneuver is a catch all [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) for when a creature wishes to do something that is not defined elsewhere in the rules. A maneuver lets the attacker present the target with a choice: suffer the damage of an attack, or suffer a custom effect. The rules for resolving maneuvers are as follows.

## When Can a Creature Perform a Maneuver?

1. When a creature is making an [Attack](Attack.md).
2. Any time before the damage from that attack is applied to the creature.
	- "Applying damage" means once the GM gives the PCs otherwise hidden information about the consequences of that damage *(It kills them, is a [Breaking Point](../Social%20Systems/Morale%20System.md#Breaking%20Points), etc.)*

## How Are Maneuver's Resolved?

The 'attacker' proposes the maneuver / effect they would like to impose on the target ***instead*** of the damage and other effects (such as [Conditions](../Conditions/!Conditions.md)) of the attack. The target chooses whether to take the damage as normal, or suffer the effect of the maneuver. The maneuver can include reduced damage in addition to its effect rather than no damage.

## What Kind of Maneuver's Can Creatures Do?

A creature can propose any maneuver. However;

- If the maneuver is clearly better than the damage rolled, the target (either the PC, or the NPC as judged by the GM) will just choose to take the damage instead.
- If the maneuver is deemed impossible by the GM, the damage is taken instead.
- Maneuvers can include items that are not part of the actual [Attack](Attack.md).
		- *Ex. A guard attempting to shackle a PC could be a maneuver, if they have a weapon handy. The PC could choose to be [Restrained](../Conditions/Restrained.md), or take the damage, "you resist and the guard hits you with his club"*
