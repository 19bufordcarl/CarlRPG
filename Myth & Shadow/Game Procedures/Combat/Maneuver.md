# Maneuver

A maneuver is an special type of [Attack](Attack.md). The effect of a maneuver is not defined. Instead, the attacker proposes an effect when they make the attack. The target of the attack chooses whether to suffer the effect *OR* suffer the damage of the attack.

The effect may include damage, [Conditions](../Conditions/{Conditions}.md), or anything else, so long as it is believable.

## Skilled Maneuvers

If the attacker has a [Background](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Background.md) or skill that would help significantly for a non-damaging maneuver, they may choose to have the defending creature make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) (10 + Attacker's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist the effect. The [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) used is the attacker's [Primary Skill](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md). Their [Primary Skill](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md) must be either [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) or [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) to do this.

## FAQ

- If a maneuver is deemed impossible by the GM, the target just takes the damage.
	- *No giving skeletons billions of gold coins.*
- Maneuver effects can use items that are not part of the actual [Attack](Attack.md).
	- *Shackling an enemy is a great example of this!*
- The GM should adjudicate the NPCs choice of effect as if they were that NPC.
	- *Dying sucks. Getting [Restrained](../Conditions/Restrained.md) is better than almost dying.*
- If using a skill to force a check, the player needs to have a good narrative explanation of how they are going to effectively perform this maneuver for it to work.
