# Maneuver

A maneuver is an special type of [Attack](Attack.md).

To perform a maneuver:

1. The attacker proposes an effect when they make the attack.
2. The target of the attack chooses either:
	1. Suffer the proposed effect.
	2. Suffer the normal damage of the attack.

The effect may include damage, [Conditions](../Conditions/{Conditions}.md), or anything else that is plausible.

## FAQ

- If a maneuver is deemed impossible by the GM, the target just takes the damage.
	- *No giving skeletons billions of gold coins.*
- Maneuver effects can use items that are not part of the actual [Attack](Attack.md).
	- *Shackling an enemy is a great example of this!*
- The GM should adjudicate the NPC's choice of effect with respect to the NPC's motivations.
	- *Dying sucks. Getting [Restrained](../Conditions/Restrained.md) is not as bad.*
