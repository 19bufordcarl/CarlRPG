# Maneuver

A maneuver is an special type of [Attack](Attack.md). The effect of a maneuver is not defined. Instead, the attacker proposes an effect when they make the attack. The target of the attack chooses whether to suffer the effect *OR* suffer the damage of the attack.

The effect may include damage, [Conditions](../Conditions/{Conditions}.md), or anything else, so long as it is believable.
