# Melee Attack

To make a *Melee Attack*, you make a [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Weaponry](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Weaponry.md)) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

You can only make a *Melee Attack* against a target that you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with.

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die plus your [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

You may use a [Reckless Attack](Melee%20Attack.md#Reckless%20Attack) on a failure.

## Reckless Attack

When you fail a *Melee Attack*, you may roll again, unless it was a [Critical Miss](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md).

Prior to this re-roll occurring, anyone [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with you may make an [Opportunity Attack](Opportunity%20Attack.md) against you with [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

## Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is anything that is not explicitly described as a weapon. Like a chair, a bottle, or fists. These attacks deal [Tier 1](Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage equal to your [Weaponry](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Weaponry.md) proficiency.
