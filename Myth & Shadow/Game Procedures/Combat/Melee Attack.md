# Melee Attack

To make a *Melee Attack*, you make a [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

You can only make a *Melee Attack* against a target that you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with.

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die plus [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

You may use a [Reckless Attack](Melee%20Attack.md#Reckless%20Attack) on a failure.

## Reckless Attack

When you fail a *Melee Attack*, you may roll again, unless it was a [Critical Miss](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md).

In order to do this, the target first gets a free *Melee Attack* against you with a bonus to accuracy equal to the difference between your [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and their [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

## Improvised Weapons

Improvised weapons and unarmed attacks deal [Tier 1](Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage equal to [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md).
