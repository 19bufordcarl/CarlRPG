# Melee Attack

To make a melee [Attack](Attack.md), you make a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) check and compare the result to the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>Deal damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die and add 1 + [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>You may end your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to [Melee Bash](Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash).
>Otherwise, the attack deals **no damage**. *See [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).*

## Melee Bash

When you fail a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md), you can perform a quick *Melee Bash* against the target.

- You deal damage equal to 1 + [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), no roll required.
	- *Note: You may use [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) if wielding a [Finesse](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Finesse%20Property.md) weapon.*
- If the attack was a [Critical Miss](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md), then you **cannot** *Melee Bash*.
- If you use a *Melee Bash*, your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) ends immediately afterwards.

## Improvised Weapons

Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal [Mundane Damage](Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to 1 + [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) on a successful [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) check against [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), and no damage on a failure. *(No melee bash option)*
