# Melee Attack

To make a *Melee Attack*, you make a [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Melee Combat](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Melee%20Combat.md)) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

You can only make a *Melee Attack* against a target that you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with.

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die plus your [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md). If you are proficient in [Melee Combat](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Melee%20Combat.md), you may choose to [Power Attack](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Power%20Attack.md) or regain [Stamina Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

You may use a [Reckless Attack](Melee%20Attack.md#Reckless%20Attack) on a failure.

## Reckless Attack

When you fail a *Melee Attack*, you may roll again, unless it was a [Critical Miss](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md).

Prior to this re-roll occurring, anyone [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with you may make an [Opportunity Attack](Opportunity%20Attack.md) against you with [Advantage](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

## Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is anything besides classical [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md). E.g. a chair, a bottle, fists, etc. Treat these as a weapon that has a 1d4 [Tier 1](Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage die.
