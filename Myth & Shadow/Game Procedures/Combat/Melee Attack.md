# Melee Attack

One of the [Attack](Attack.md) types.

To make a *Melee Attack*, you make a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

You can only make a *Melee Attack* against a target that you are [Engaged](../Conditions/Engaged.md) with.

## Damage

On a successful [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals damage equal to the [Weapon's](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) damage die plus [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md).

On a failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The attack deals **no damage**.

You may treat a failed check as a successful check by using a [Melee Bash](Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash).

## Melee Bash

When you fail a *Melee Attack*, you may force it to be a success, unless it was a [Critical Miss](../Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md).

To do so, you reduce your [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) by the difference between the failed [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and the target's [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md).

## Improvised Weapons

Improvised weapons, including unarmed attacks, [Mundane Damage](Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) equal to [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md).
