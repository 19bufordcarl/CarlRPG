# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time when no other [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) is occurring.

You can take one reaction per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## Ready

On your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you may specify an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) and [Movement](Movement.md) you wish to take when something happens prior to your next turn. You gain this as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next turn.

The following rules apply to readying:

- The readied action will occur right **before** its trigger.
- In order to ready a [Reaction](Reaction.md), it uses **both** your [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) and [Movement](Movement.md).
- After readying, your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) immediately ends.
- This can only be done in [Combat](Combat.md) on your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

***Example***:
- *Player 1: When the ghoul gets out from cover, I want to shoot them with my arrow.*
- *GM: Got it, you knock an arrow and prepare to fire. Player 2, your turn!*
