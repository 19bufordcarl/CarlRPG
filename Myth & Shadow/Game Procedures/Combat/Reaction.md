# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time when no other [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) is occurring.

You can take one reaction per [Round](../Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

## Ready

On your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you may specify an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) you wish to take when something happens prior to your next turn. You gain this [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) as a [Reaction](Reaction.md) until your next turn. The readied action will occur right *before* its trigger. After readying an action, your turn immediately ends.

***Example***:
- *Player 1: When the ghoul gets out from cover, I want to shoot them with my arrow.*
- *GM: Got it, you knock an arrow and prepare to fire. Player 2, your turn!*

### FAQ

*Readying an action can only be done within [Combat](Combat.md). You must setup circumstances to gain [Surprise](../Conditions/Surprised.md) if you want the benefits of readying an action outside of / prior to combat.*
