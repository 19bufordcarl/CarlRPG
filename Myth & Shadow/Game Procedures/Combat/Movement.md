# Movement

On a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your speed. A PC's base speed is 1 zone.

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to double your [Movement](Movement.md) this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Difficult terrain imposes difficult movement on affected creatures. Other difficult movement examples include crawling, sneaking, wading, swimming, and climbing.

*If playing with [Abstract](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) distance, difficult terrain forces you make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, you cannot leave your current zone until your next [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).*

## Movement Through Enemies

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass, unless that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md), [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), or otherwise incapable of stopping you.

For creatures 2 [Sizes](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Sizes) larger than you, treat their space as [Difficult Movement](#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in their space, you make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) where XX is equal to 10 + their [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) and fall [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) as they nearly crush you.

*Note: You can move through an ally's space freely.*

## Variable Speed

PCs have a base move speed of 1 [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).

PCs gain an additional [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) of movement at 5 [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md),

*If playing with [Abstract](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) distance, PCs get another zone move at 5 and 10 [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).*
