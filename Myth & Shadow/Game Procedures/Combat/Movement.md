# Movement

On a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your speed (default of 30 feet or 1 zone).

If playing with [Measurement](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Measurement), movement can be discontinuous, meaning you can move 10 feet, [Attack](Attack.md), pick up a shield, and then move 15 feet.

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to gain [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include: Difficult Terrain, crawling, sneaking, wading, swimming, climbing.

## Movement Minor Actions

You can spend 5 feet of movement to either:

- Stand up from [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md)
- Interact with large items (around the size of a standard [Shield](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Mundane%20Armor/Mundane%20Shield.md))

*If playing with abstract distance, you may do **one** of these as a [Free Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Free%20Action) and still move.*

## Movement Through Enemies

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), you may move through its space.

For creatures 2 [Sizes](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Sizes) larger than you, treat their space as [Difficult Movement](#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in their space, you must make a [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) check with a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 + their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) and fall [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) as they nearly crush you.

*Note: You can move through allies freely.*

## Variable Speed

*Optional*
PCs have a base move speed of 30 feet, or 1 zone.

If their [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md) allows it, increase their speed by 5 feet times [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

If playing with [Abstract](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) geometry, PCs get 2 zone moves if they have at least 5 [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

### NPC Variable Speed

For the GM, an NPC's speed is simply what it is defined to be in their [Stat Block](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Quick%20Monster%20Statblocks.md).
