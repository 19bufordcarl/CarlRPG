# Movement

On a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your speed. A PC's base speed is 1 [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to double your [Movement](Movement.md) this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement requires the creature make a [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Survival](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Survival.md)) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md). If they fail, they lose 1 [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) of movement this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). If this reduces their remaining movement speed to 0, they are halted in place. If they are climbing, they fall. The [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is proportional to the intensity of the situation.

Difficult movement consists of crawling, sneaking, wading, swimming, climbing, etc. An area with difficult terrain, such as a swampy bog, imposes difficult movement on affected creatures.

*Some creatures may be trained to overcome certain types of these difficulties.*

## Movement Through Enemies

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass, unless that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md), [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), or otherwise incapable of stopping you.

For creatures much larger than you, treat their space as [Difficult Movement](#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in their space, you make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) where XX is equal to 10 + their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) and fall [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) as they nearly crush you.

*Note: You can move through an ally's space freely.*

## Variable Speed

PCs have a base move speed of 1 [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).

PCs gain an additional [Zone](../Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) of movement at 3 [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md), and at 5 [Stamina](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md).
