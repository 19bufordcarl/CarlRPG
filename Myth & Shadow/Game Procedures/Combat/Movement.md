# Movement

On a [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move a distance up to your speed (default of 30 feet or 1 zone).

*If playing with [Measurement](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Measurement) distance, movement can be discontinuous, meaning you can move 10 feet, [Attack](Attack.md), and then move 20 feet.*

## Dash

You can spend an [Action](../Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to gain [Movement](Movement.md) equal to your normal [Movement](Movement.md) speed this [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Difficult terrain imposes difficult movement on affected creatures. Other difficult movement examples include crawling, sneaking, wading, swimming, and climbing.

*If playing with [Abstract](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) distance, make a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, you cannot leave your current zone until your next [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).*

## Movement Through Enemies

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass, unless that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md), [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md), or otherwise incapable of stopping you.

For creatures 2 [Sizes](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Sizes) larger than you, treat their space as [Difficult Movement](#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](../Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in their space, you make a [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../Core%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to (10 + their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)). If you fail, you take damage equal to their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) and fall [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) as they nearly crush you.

*Note: You can move through allies freely.*

## Variable Speed

PCs have a base move speed of 30 feet, or 1 zone.

If their [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md) allows it, increase their speed by 5 feet times [Half](../Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

*If playing with [Abstract](../Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) distance, PCs get another zone move at 5 and 10 [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).*
