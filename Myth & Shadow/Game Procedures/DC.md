# Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class (DC) represents the number that needs to be rolled on a given [Check](Check.md) for it to be successful.

A DC should rarely require the natural dice result to be lower than 5 or higher than 18.

## Default DCs

- 10 for easy checks
- 15 for normal checks *(When in doubt the GM should choose 15)*
- 20 for hard checks
- 25 for extreme checks

## Rare DCs

- 5 is too low usually.
	- It should only be used for very easy checks for PCs with a terrible relevant ability.
	- If a PC can only fail on a natural 1, consider a guaranteed success.
- 30 is nearly impossible.
	- It should only be used for the *nearly* impossible.
	- If a player can only succeed on a natural 20, consider a guaranteed fail.

For things where there is no time pressure, the GM can also use the PCs ability score as is without a roll to decide whether they can do the action if randomness does not make sense.

*Author's Note:*
*The GM should set the DC prior to the roll for a check, and should communicate the DC to the player prior to the roll unless there is a good narrative reason why the player wouldn't have any notion how difficult the task at hand is. A player should be sure the GM has set the DC before rolling to preserve the integrity of the DC.*
