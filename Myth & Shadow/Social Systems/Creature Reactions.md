# Creature Reactions
When encountering a likely hostile creature from a random table, usually when [Delving](../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md) or during an [Overland Journey](../Game%20Procedures/Overland%20Journeys.md), if the creature would not clearly be hostile, then the GM rolls for its reaction.
- Undead would clearly be hostile for example.

The GM may add [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) the [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) of the relevant PC to the 2d6 roll.

| 2d6        | Reaction                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 6 or less  | Violent: Attacks the PCs             |
| 7-9        | Wary: Might attack if provoked       |
| 10         | Neutral: Indifferent to the PCs      |
| 11         | Cordial: Willing to talk / negotiate |
| 12 or more | Friendly: Willing to help out a bit  |
*Author's Note:*

*GMs, do not overlook this. This is the main mechanical benefit of [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) for non casters. It can let you avoid monster encounters. If the creature is likely not hostile, you should use the [Social Reactions](Social%20Reactions.md) system.*
