# Creature Reactions

When encountering a likely hostile creature from a random table, usually when [Delving](../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md) or during an [Overland Journey](../Game%20Procedures/Overland%20Journeys.md), if the creature would not clearly be hostile, then the GM rolls for its reaction.

- Undead would clearly be hostile for example.

The GM may add [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) the [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) of the relevant PC to the 2d6 roll.

| 2d6        | Reaction                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6 or less  | Violent: Attacks the PCs (or flees if frightened)                                                         |
| 7-9        | Wary: Might attack if provoked (reroll in 1 [Combat Round](../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round)) |
| 10-11      | Neutral: Indifferent to the PCs                                                                           |
| 12 or more | Cordial: Willing to talk / negotiate                                                                      |

*Author's Note:*

*GMs, do not overlook this. This is the main mechanical benefit of [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) for non casters. It can let you avoid monster encounters. If the creature is likely not hostile, you should use the [Social Reactions](Social%20Reactions.md) system.*
