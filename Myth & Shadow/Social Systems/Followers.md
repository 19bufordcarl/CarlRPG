# Followers
Followers follow the PC into great danger, even the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), for promise of lavish loot.
## Level Requirement
A PC can start attracting followers once they reach 7th [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), having become renown for their great deeds. A Follower's level cannot exceed the PCs.
## Max Number
A PC can have a number of Followers equal to their [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus their [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md).
## Finding Followers
Generally, you can only find Followers who start out as level 0 mercenaries (see [NPC Hirelings](NPC%20Hirelings.md)). Upon hiring them, they become level 1 Followers, and operate effectively as another PC.
### Cost
Followers need a certain amount of money (or loot equivalent) per week to justify their risk and not look for another adventuring party. If their share of loot at the end of a month is less than the four times the rate in the table below, the Follower makes a loyalty [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they leave for better opportunities.

| Follower Level | Cost per Week (coins, 7 days) |
| -------------: | ----------------------------: |
|              1 |                               |
|              2 |                           250 |
|              3 |                           500 |
|              4 |                         1,000 |
|              5 |                         2,000 |
|              6 |                         3,000 |
|              7 |                         4,000 |
|              8 |                         5,000 |
|              9 |                         6,000 |
|             10 |                        10,000 |
Followers are along primarily for the loot. Narrative 'Followers' should simply be GM controlled NPCs that accompany the party, and have stats tracked by the GM rather than a true Follower.
### Availability
For every 10 available [NPC Hireling](NPC%20Hirelings.md) Merchants, there should be roughly 1 who is willing to be a Follower. The GM can also design specific Followers if they so desire.

## Leveling Up

### Session Method XP
If the PC is two levels higher after they [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), the Follower also levels up. In addition to the normal [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) procedure, increase their loyalty score by 1. (This means that Followers will typically be 1 level lower than the party).
### Treasure Method XP
- **Hardcore:** The Followers only gain XP for the treasure that is part of their share.
- **Easy:** The Followers gain XP with the party.

## Loyalty Checks

Loyalty is the system to handle when Followers will abandon the party. To make a loyalty check, the PC who is responsible for the Follower makes a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). The PC may add the Follower's Loyalty Score as an additional bonus to this [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

The GM should request a loyalty check whenever the following occurs.
- Hardship
	- Offensive actions to the Follower.
		- The GM may grant [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) if it is especially against their nature.
			- Such as not paying them on time or lying about their pay.
		- This should also decrease their loyalty score by 1.
	- In sudden unexpected danger. 
		- Such as a lich awakening from his tomb to a level 2 Follower. 
- Opportunity
	- When the party ends a session in a civilized area having not met the Follower's rate.
		- This should also decrease their loyalty score by 1.
	- If the follower comes across a particularly powerful artifact / offer.

If a Follower fails a loyalty check they leave the party and will not work for that PC again. (Or the party as long as that PC is in the party). They take any items they have on them with them.
### Loyalty Score
A Follower's loyalty score represents how likely they are to stick with the party. A new Follower has a loyalty score of 0. Loyalty scores change on the following events.

- Increase loyalty by 1
	- Whenever the Follower gains a level.
	- Whenever a PC saves the Follower from near certain death.
	- Whenever the payment for a month comes out to more than twice the expected rate.
- Decrease loyalty by 1
	- Whenever a PC does an offensive action to the Follower that prompts a check.
	- Whenever their monthly rate fails to be met.
