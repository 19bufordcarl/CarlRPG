# Social Reactions

In general, the expectation is that most behavior is handled by PCs roleplaying and *no die rolls are made to 'persuade'*. If the referee cannot decide how an NPC would react, a simple [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) can be called for with a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) set by the referee given the context, and the result of the roll influences the reaction. 
## Initial Reaction
If a creature's initial reaction would not be clear, the referee calls for a [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

| Check Result                           | Creature's Reaction       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Natural 1 (or a result of 1 or less)   | Hatred / Strong Dislike   |
| Less than 5                            | Negative                  |
| 5-14                                   | Neutral                   |
| 15 or more                             | Positive                  |
| Natural 20 (or a result of 20 or more) | Helpful / Strong Fondness |
