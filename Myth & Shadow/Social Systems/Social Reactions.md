# Social Reactions

In general, the expectation is that most behavior is handled by PCs roleplaying and *no die rolls are made to 'persuade'*. If the GM feels the NPCs reaction is debatable, they can ask the PC to make a [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), and use the result to decide how the NPC responds.

By default, the following table should be used to determine the reaction in such circumstances. The GM may adjust the ranges to fit the situation at hand, and will decide exactly what "Neutral" or "Positive" means in the given situation.

| Check Result (DC) | Check Result (Range)                                                                         | Creature's Reaction       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| natural 1         | 1 or less (or a [Critical Failure](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md)) | Hatred / Strong Dislike   |
| DC 2              | 2-4                                                                                          | Negative                  |
| DC 5              | 5-14                                                                                         | Neutral                   |
| DC 15             | 15-19                                                                                        | Positive                  |
| DC 20             | 20+ (or a [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md))       | Helpful / Strong Fondness |
