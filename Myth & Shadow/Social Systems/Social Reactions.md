# Social Reactions

In general, the expectation is that most behavior is handled by PCs roleplaying and *no die rolls are made to 'persuade'*. If the referee cannot decide how an NPC would react, a simple [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) can be called for with a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) set by the referee given the context, and the result of the roll influences the reaction.
