# Social Reactions

In general, the expectation is that most behavior is handled by PCs roleplaying and *no die rolls are made to 'persuade'*. If the referee cannot decide how an NPC would react, they can ask the PC to make a [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), and the result of the roll influences the reaction. 

By default, the following table should be used to determine the reaction in these circumstances. The referee may adjust these numbers based on circumstance.

| Check Result (DC) | Check Result (Range)                                                                         | Creature's Reaction       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| natural 1         | 1 or less (or a [Critical Failure](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md)) | Hatred / Strong Dislike   |
| DC 2              | 2-4                                                                                          | Negative                  |
| DC 5              | 5-14                                                                                         | Neutral                   |
| DC 15             | 15-19                                                                                        | Positive                  |
| DC 20             | 20+ (or a [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md))       | Helpful / Strong Fondness |
