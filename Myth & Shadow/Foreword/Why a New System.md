# Why a New System?
## 5e
5e is great for its network externalities, and the character creations options are reasonable, but the setting information, economy, and other stuff that you need to run a campaign setting are entirely left to the DM.

Moreover the character creation options then clash with this, having setting specific races, items, and other abilities that can have a huge impact on the game, meaning that starting every campaign also means deciding how exactly players are allowed to build characters, coupled with an absolutely massive amount of character creation sub choices that are not balanced for combat and thus can severely hinder new players ability to play and feel close to as impactful as experienced players without just being told what to do.

- I count someone saying well I want to be someone who’s good with a bow and then telling them to be a specific subclass that does that as telling them what to do.

New players in my experience are rarely actually read through their abilities before getting into play because how could they. Heck, even I my first time playing 5e just picked a premade character online because I thought a Druid sounded cool but good god the amount of stuff I had to configure for that was insane.

At this point were changing so many things, why use the system at all? In my case, its mainly just because I can look up 5e on online wikis or use vtt modules that I can't for other systems.
## DCC
My first time playing dnd was a level 0 DCC game and that character creation was awesome as a new player. I rolled up stats and got excited over big numbers. I then put those numbers in stats. I wanted to be someone who had been infected with lycanthropy but hadn’t transformed yet, so I put a lot of stuff into strength and constitution because I’d want to be a big frontliner.

The 6 ability scores were easy to understand, and the only complexity was if you wanted to build intelligence you had to roll up a random spell, but that’s easy enough to decline as a new.
## An Aside: Let’s talk about “Classes”
This I think is the beginning of illustrating the problems I have with 5e. You need to choose So. SO. Many. ”Classes”.  For the purposes of game design, I treat a “class” as a bundling of different defined game actions and their effects under a single system, typically represented by a number (I.e. class level) for the purpose of simulating the “real” world the game is trying to represent. 
- (Note, “65% chance to hit melee attacks” vs. “85% chance to hit melee attacks” *are different game actions* just like knowing magic vs not knowing magic, albeit of potentially different power levels relative to the game. You cannot choose to do melee attacks with that probability, but I can, I have access to a choice that you do not).

This bundling of actions is necessary to make sure that some players have different capabilities than other players, if every possible game action is equally available to all players then this an equal resource game, like chess. Both players have access to the same resources at the start and strategy is the only way to gain a resource advantage.

### RPGs as games

Games like that can be fun, but this is not really how many RPGs play for the reason that I want my character to have certain abilities so I can express tactical skill through the choices that I make in deciding what abilities my character gets rather than “pure gameplay” (building is part of the game / fun imo). It’s a similar concept to deck building games, if you think of the deck like your character and the cards like the abilities. Pokémon is also this kind of game, you build your team. I personally prefer these kind of games. I like the creative freedom in expressing how I want my “character” to be represented in the game, it makes me personally attached to it.

### The problem with too many classes
Now that we have a useful shorthand that a “Class” is really just a bundling of abilities, how many classes do I need to choose in 5e?
- Well I need to choose my race class
- I also need to choose my ability score classes
- Should probably look into the background classes too
- Oh don’t forget my real main class, that gets most of my abiltiies
- of Course most main classes also need a subclass
- Those affect my skill classes too, which might be relevant
- And I have a bunch of different item classes I can choose from, most don’t matter I think but weapon and armor seem important

And those are just the ones that affect combat off the top of my head.

Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong with having a lot of classes, it’s giving players a lot of choices about how they want to build their character, which is a key part of the game. But there is such a thing as information overload.

### Pokemon
Let’s take a look at one of my favorite games of all times. I started playing Pokémon before I could read most of the words on the screen. I had no issue getting started. At the beginning of the game, you get to choose from 1 of 3 starter Pokémon (classes). Now, as the game goes on, I’ll be able to catch lots more pokemon, but the game isn’t asking me to build a team of 6 right from the start. I get to choose 1. Now I can quickly get more, and build out my team, but I’m not stuck at character creation needing to choose from millions of class combinations.
### Back to RPG design
Now, I don’t think you need to reduce character creation choices down to fire, water, grass to have a good game, but I do think you should try to limit players choices at character creation to the absolute minimum that you can to play the kind of game you are striving for.

This brings us to the solution I see which is to reduce redundancy. At character creation, players should not be specializing too much. That should happen as they level up. So, I should require them to make the same basic choice in multiple different places to decide what exact kind of abilities they want

#### Intelligence Example
If intelligence is used for wizard spells, and basically just wizard spells for combat purposes, why do we need to make players look through a whole separate wizard class and subclass tree to cast spells? They saw that int was used for spellcasting and wanted to increase it to cast spells, why do we have this redundant option? Presumably for balance reasons so that any old high intelligence fighter can’t cast spells. But then what if that player decides latter on that they do want to learn spells? Should it be impossible? How did the wizard learn spells in the first place though it’s obviously possible. Should we make a multiclass class? 5e says yes. I don’t think we had enough classes guys!

Let’s compare this to my level 0 DCC game. I rolled up 16 numbers, and had 6 choices to make. Additionally, I had a few coins to buy some basic gear. In our group of around 5 players, 2 of whom had played before, this took about 45 min to get everyone up to speed on how the game works, make characters, and start playing. This is considered long by most board game standards, but the character creation process is in itself, to an extent, fun. When this time starts to dramatically increase, or to the point where you can’t even make a character in the same session you play because there are so many class choices to learn, then I think we have an issue.
#### Complex character creation
In my ideal system, any character creation option that takes an average board gamer new to ttrpgs longer than ~45 minutes should not be the default character creation. New players to your game should be able to go through a character creation walk through and be ready to go in less than an hour without needing to simple be given a prebuilt sheet. This is plenty of time for meaningful choices, and you can leave other choices to higher levels, which gives players something to look forward to.
### Character creation broadly
More broadly, I find systems that use classes to frontload far too many choices for your character to the creation screen. Imagine if when you played Pokémon you had to choose all 6 Pokémon and couldn’t swap them out the whole game. That’s what games with classes feel like to me. Sure my Pokémon can learn moves, but I can’t ever really change them and I don’t like that.

5e attempts to mitigate this with multiclassing, but its implementation doesn’t fix the actual issue here. The issue is that my choice of class at level 1 (or subclass at levels 2,3) is likely the most mechanically meaningful choice my character will make throughout the campaign. Even if I want to multiclass later, player who do that are usually planning out their character build well in advance of the game. They’re not reacting to the campaign / narrative as it develops, but rather building a preset idea of a (usually powerful) character. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this and I’ve no quarrel with players who enjoy that, it seems to be what the rules are pushing you towards.

That’s just not the design I *want* the rules to push you towards.
## Knave

Discovering knave 1e was a breath of fresh air for me. I’m aware it’s not the first to do this, but it was my first exposure to a classless dnd like system. I played a lot of elder scrolls games in my days, and I learned that they were heavily inspired by runequest, a d100 skill / attribute system (hence the classic Sneak 100 meme).

I vastly prefer the core ethos behind these kind of “classes”. Everything you can do in game is bundle into an ability / skill. You can choose to invest in any of these skills and abilities to sort of build your own class as you level up. I think this allows for a lot of character expression, while also naturally letting a player realize, “hmm my sword and board strategy seems to be lagging in this campaign setting, or maybe I just don’t vibe with it. I’m gonna start building into spell casting too, and I’ll be like a hybrid!” They don’t have to look up any multiclass rules, or special half magic feats to achieve this. They just start learning spells, presumably the same way the wizard started learning spells. Bad at first, and gets better each level.

Unfortunately, knave isn’t really a full system so much as it is just an alternate character generation option. Nowadays with knave 2e it has been expanded to be closer to a full system. I thought this might be the solution to my need to homebrew a bunch of hacky rules for my group. With all due respect to Ben some of the design choices he made in 2e perplex me a bit. I think this [blog post](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/analysis-knave-2e) does a good respectful critique. Now I’m going to go on to critique some things about Knave 2e, but I want to make clear that I am critiquing the technical design here, I respect Ben a great deal and he was a huge reason I got started writing my own homebrew in the first place, but I just don’t think this 2e system facilitates the type of game I would enjoy running or playing.
### “Rulings over Rules”
I have a love hate relationship with this saying. On the one hand, I agree with a lot of the ethos behind it. The game is built on trust, the GM / referee / whoever needs to be trusted to make a reasonable ruling and have everyone respect it and have fun with that game.

That being said, I’d like to define what exactly rulings over rules means to me. I’m going to quote some relevant parts of that blog post above to set the stage.

*“””*
#### *Rules as Written*

*In most modern legal systems, we have both [legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation) (rules written by law-makers) and [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) (precedent created by judges). In a court case, typically what happens (at a high level), is that the judge will hear the case, then interpret and apply any relevant legislation,then look at the precedent created by past judges ruling on similar cases, and finally decide if they want to create new precedent or side with history.*

*This is exactly what a GM does in a TTRPG. The system designer creates a rulebook that lays out the legislation. When a situation arises, the GM interprets and applies rules from the rulebook. If the rulebook doesn’t cover the situation (or does so badly), the GM attempts to interpret the spirit of the rulebook to create a new ruling. This creates a precedent for future rulings (that may be overturned if it’s for the best).*

*It is the aim of [some rulebooks](https://www.sjgames.com/gurps/) to provide legislation for as many situations as possible. The idea is “it’s there if you need it, but you don’t have to use it”, which is how we get exhaustively detailed math for how long it takes to pickaxe through the various thicknesses of different materials. The downside is that much of the rulebook becomes “noise” (it’s harder to find one rule in a book of 10000 rules than a book of 10 rules), and that as a GM, it feels very compelling to use a rule if it’s there, so much of the “play” becomes remembering/interpreting legislation rather than imagining fiction.*

*The aim of [other rulebooks](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/399483/Into-the-Odd--Remastered) is to provide way less specific legislation, but for each of the rules to be broadly applicable and for it to be easy to interpret the spirit of the rulebook to easily create rulings with its framework.*
*“””*

So we see the issue that rules can become cumbersome, especially when printed into a book where each word on that pickaxe math is as space valuable as the words for melee attacks, despite the vast difference in frequency.
- *(hmm if only there were some way to reduce this noise, like a magical digital hologram with links to the most relevant information and all connected information for each page rather than dyeing the remains of tree bark, oh yea a wiki!)*

But there’s another side to this that I feel can get overlooked in the modern OSR zeitgeist, as the blog goes on to start its critique.

*“””*
#### *Page By Page Stream of Consciousness*

> *Nothing in these rules is sacrosanct. The rules at your table will evolve over the course of a campaign, as you and your players tailor them to fit the way you like to play. This is a good thing. Altering the rules and writing your own is a time-honored part of the hobby and a critical part of becoming a great Game Master (and, in time, a game designer).*

*I’m quoting this up-front because I want to get out ahead of it. Just because the rules aren’t sacrosanct, and just because tables can (and are encouraged to) change and tailor them, does not mean they’re immune to criticism or praise. If I release a book with nothing but hot garbage between the bindings, it’s not okay just because I say “they were just suggestions man, change them if they’re not working for ya”. Likewise, if I release the most platonically ideal set of TTRPG rules, they deserve praise, even if I make this disclaimer.*
*“””*
## Rules Matter
Clearly, the rules matter. Otherwise we wouldn’t be printing all these books. But, also we don’t want to get overly detailed? 

The devils in the details. 

Rulings over rules is all about where we draw the line, and the connotation behind that statement is that the pendulum has swung too far and we have too many rules for things that shouldn’t be specified in the book. 

Now that prompts the question, what kinds of things, exactly, shouldn’t have rules? You see designing a system is like jazz, it’s about the notes you don’t play. But which notes precisely? And why? Let’s recall one of Ben’s videos about [freekriegspiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lvrC3ZBzM), one of the ancestors to modern table top gaming. In order to play this game, you needed an experienced military officer of some sort, usually a retired general, to adjudicate the actions by the players to make sure that they were possible and the consequences were realistic. Taken to it's fullest, that’s what rulings over rules entails, as Ben explains. We don't *need* rules to play TTRPG. The referee needs to use their expertise to represent the setting appropriately and model things. 

But we’re releasing a rule book, and so what rules do we believe should be legislated rather than interpreted?

As Ben points out, you need to have expertise in the setting and trust amongst your players in order to work. Ben states that he doesn't run full FKR, but implements some of the philosophies. So again we're back to which notes aren't we playing? Why? Let's dig in and see if we can find some answers.

### Knave 2e
According to Knave 2e notes that need to be played include things like character ability scores and check resolution, movement speed, dungeon crawling and overland travel hazards, item slots for carrying things, spells that require items to cast, alchemy, etc.

In some places, like the XP gain for levels, and equivalently then the economy, it seems oddly detailed, but also internally inconsistent as well as incompatible with BX broadly (see the blog post for the number). I’m not really sure how this looks at his tables. When I ran my knave 2e draft campaign I had to rework most of the prices to be balanced to the resources that party had. If a system is going through the effort to detail something rather than leave it to rulings over rules, I would like whatever they specify to work out of the box.

So we can change these rules, but it leaves me wondering, why put them here? Is this an indication to the referee that these rules need to be clearly spelled out prior to the campaign, even if you change them? What is the balancing of this trying to achieve? Given that item slots seem to be quite important, and I can presumably buy things with the mountains of gold from the dragon hoard, why are these rules spelled out in the way that they are? 

There are other parts of the system, especially combat with the breaking weapons, armor point / AC limitations and pricing, fire and other environmental damage, that generally just seem a bit unbalanced and confusing to me.

Meanwhile there are things like spell abilities and 
### Shadowdark Rules
Shadowdark agrees that things like check resolution, and abilities / classes need to covered in the rules, but for some other things it’s a bit less clear. Conditions are not specified in shadowdark, for example. So when I cast hold person and paralyze someone, I don’t know what that actually means, it’s up to the GM, (the retired general), to adjudicate this. 

The problem here starts to reveal itself. I am not a retired wizard from your fantasy setting. I don’t know how hold person works. Presumably spells when cast successfully should work the same way every time? There are critical casts but the effect for that is clearly spelled out. There’s all this spell text that the player read and decided they wanted based on the abilities it granted them, I don’t want to disrespect that, so what do I do? They just can’t move, and thus can’t attack? Seems ok I guess? Well but 5e says melee attacks auto crit, because AC represents you defending yourself which you can’t do while paralyzed, and shadowdark says the same about ac, so maybe it’s an auto crit? But wait is that too strong relative to other 2nd level spells? Are players who didn’t choose hold person because they didn’t realize it did that going to feel like I arbitrarily invalidated their choices by making this spell better?

Maybe I should just tell my players what paralysis means before they take the spell, so they know what to expect and can choose their spells with the knowledge of what they actually do. Or maybe they aren’t supposed to know? And I keep it hidden? Regardless, I should probably write down whatever I decide so I don’t forget it and can reference it whenever hold person comes up.

Wait a minute. I just wrote the paralysis condition. In this system, the referee has to design the paralysis condition on the spot, or make their own ahead of time. Why is this information deemed a note to not be played? I expect players to cast their spells, so I know it’ll come up in play, it’s not irrelevant like the pickaxe digging speed example.

Let’s see what Kelsey has to say (about the stupefied condition).

“””
A good question! Everyone has come up with a good answer, and all of them work.

There are no defined conditions because it's a race to the bottom (every possible state of physical or mental alteration would then need to be defined). It also requires a lot of looking up and remembering.

When in doubt, give disadvantage!

If it were me, I'd give the character disadvantage on anything requiring focus or brain power, and would only allow them to move a close distance on their turn as they wobble around.

For GMs who are concerned their players will disengage with that level of disruption, they might choose to just impose disadvantage, or something different like making them unable to speak or use ranged attacks.

I hope that helps! :)

-Kelsey
“””

I half agree with what Kelsey is saying. On the point that conditions add a lot of looking up and remembering rules rather than gameplay, yes this is true, especially if you’re using a pdf / book rather than a wiki with internal links for quick lookup. The wiki format for rules alleviates a lot of this issue in my opinion though, but still the point holds that the more we add the more complex the less human interaction.

On the point that it’s a race to the bottom to define every mental and physical condition, I disagree. Let’s take a look at a toy example to see the underlying assumption here. “Designing a fantasy roleplaying game is a race to the bottom because you’d have to design a rule for every possible fantasy scenario”. Hmm, well clearly we don’t agree with that, we’re trying to do rules light systems. Again we’re back to rulings over rules. It’s not about not playing any notes, it’s about the notes you don’t play. I don’t need a condition for typhoid fever. I can assume this fantasy game isn’t accurately simulating real world microbiology. I think I do need a condition for the magical spell for which I have no context on how it would function which I know players are going to cast. While it won’t be clear for all things where the fall on the spectrum of the line, and people might disagree, I feel that spell effects that the players can choose at level up fall on the side of needs to know.
### So what do we specify and how?
This one is 
## Mechanism Design
So now that I’ve establish the issues I have with other systems
