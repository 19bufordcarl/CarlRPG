# Level 0 Rationale

Level 1 in this game has you start with HP more closely akin to that of a Level 2 character in Shadowdark, or other games based on the math of BX. This is to avoid the instant death / dying common to the many characters that roll 1 HP. Level 0 provides an option to create that feel more, and I believe is a more appropriate place for that level of lethality. The game should be lethal, but guaranteed dying in 1 hit feels more level 0 to me.

## A Note about Increased effective HP (FP + HP)

Variance is fun, but a spread of 1-14 starting HP (which is the variance in Shadowdark by default from a frail mage to a dwarf fighter) is too much variance for my taste. Level 1 in this game has a spread of 3-18 for starting effective HP (eHP), but it gives players a bit more control over it.

It is vanishingly unlikely for you to have more than 16 starting eHP, this requires multiple 3s / 18s. It would also be a deliberate (and likely poor) choice from a player to start with fewer than 6 eHP. As long as your [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) isn't negative you have at least 6 eHP. This is still small enough to work with the math of BX, while just smoothing off the rough edges. This system is roughly equivalent to the house rule that for your level 1 HP roll you take the max.

On average, a PC who prioritizes being healthy will be able to get ~12-13 eHP, which is also true for Shadowdark provided that they rolled high on CON and HP. We've just give the player the choice. That is the main difference between this system and Shadowdark, the players choose their PC rather than discover their PC. This system allows you to play closer to that "discover the character" style.
