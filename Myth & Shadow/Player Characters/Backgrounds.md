# Backgrounds

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

It can be whatever you want. It should not provide any combat benefits, but it does determine what knowledge your character would have in the world. A scholar would know a lot about history, while a street kid would know who the power players in the undercity are. 

Backgrounds, by default, do not provide [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on any [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). They are only used for determining what knowledge of the world your PC would have, and help the player decide how they should roleplay the character.

Feel free to choose one, roll on a table, or make a custom background with your referee’s blessing.
