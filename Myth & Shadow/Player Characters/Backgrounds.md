# Backgrounds
Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) associated with your background.
## Flavor
It can be whatever you want. It does not provide any additional benefits, but it does determine what knowledge your character would have in the world. A scholar would know a lot about history, while a street kid would know who the power players in the undercity are. 

If your favored ability is [Intelligence](Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), you can also know up to 2 ancient languages. (See [Ancestry](Ancenstries/Ancestry.md))

Feel free to choose one, roll on a table, or make a custom background with your GM’s blessing.
## Example Table
The background table from Shadowdark quick start has some good ideas, below for reference. (I changed it slightly to fit my preferences).
