# Experience Points (XP)

Experience Points represent the PCs progression throughout the game.

## Milestone XP

At the end of a session, the GM grants the *Party* between 1 and 10 XP.

When a PC has 10 XP, they can [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up). Their XP then resets to 0.

The GM can determine how they want to award this XP based on the campaign, the expected wealth serves as a rough guideline for how quickly the party should be getting XP if you are using loot tables from OSE where 10 [Coins](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Coins.md) = 1 gold piece.

## Expected Wealth By Level

The table below spells out the expectation for the wealth of a PC at a given [Level](Level.md).

|      PC Level | Net Wealth |
| ------------: | ---------: |
|             0 |        100 |
|             1 |      1,000 |
|             2 |     10,000 |
|             3 |     20,000 |
|             4 |     50,000 |
|             5 |    100,000 |
|             6 |    200,000 |
|             7 |    500,000 |
|             8 |  1,000,000 |
|             9 |  2,000,000 |
|            10 |  3,000,000 |
| Higher Levels | +1 million |

### Old School

*Optional Rule*
You may instead use a PC's wealth to determine when they can [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).
