# Scars

The [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md) condition causes a PC to gain [Scars](Scars.md). Whenever the PC gains a scar, the player should change the description of the PC slightly to reflect this scar.

## Max Scar Threshold

A PC's *Max Scar Threshold* is equal to 5 + their [Health](../Attributes/Health.md).

When a PC meets or exceeds their *Max Scar Threshold* they are at [Deaths Door](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deaths%20Door.md).

*Scars can only be healed by powerful magic â€” [5th Level Spells](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md) or greater.*
