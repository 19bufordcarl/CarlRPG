# Level (LV)

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases by 1 whenever they [Level Up](#Level%20Up), which they may do when they achieve the required [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md).

## Level Up

When you level up, you gain the following points to distribute:

1. 15 points to increase your [Point Pools](../Point%20Pools/Point%20Pools.md)
	1. *You cannot increase any single point pool by more than 10 per level up*
2. X [Skill Points](../Skills/Skills.md#Skill%20Points) where X is twice the level you **reached**
	1. *You can only spend [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) of these points on [Primary Skills](../Skills/Skills.md#Primary%20Skills)*

Levelling up may require [Downtime](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) or [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md) depending on the campaign's pacing.

## Max Level

While there is no hard cap, generally Level 10 is expected to be the max level for a PC. Beyond that, while point pools and bonuses can continue to increase, they are generally no more unique powerful abilities for PCs to acquire and growth becomes more incremental.
