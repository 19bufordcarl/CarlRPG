# Level (LV)

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever they [Level Up](#Level%20Up), which they may do when they achieve the required [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md).

## Level Up

When you level up, you increase **one** [Attribute Score](../Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) by one.

At odd levels, you may also increase a **different** [Attribute Scores](../Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) by one.

Levelling up may require [Downtime](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) or [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md) depending on the campaign's pacing.

## Max Level

While there is no hard cap, generally Level 10 is expected to be the max level for a PC.
