# Background
Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) associated with your background.
## Flavor
It can be whatever you want, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the setting. This "flavor" is used to determine what knowledge your character would have in the world. A **scholar** would know a lot about history, while a **street kid** would know who the power players in the undercity are. 

If your favored ability is [Intelligence](Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), you can also know up to 2 ancient languages. (See [Ancestry](Ancenstries/Ancestry.md))

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.
