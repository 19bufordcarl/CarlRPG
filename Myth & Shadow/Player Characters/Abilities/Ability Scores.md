# Ability Scores

There are 6 ability scores. They cannot go above +10.

- [Strength](Strength.md)
- [Dexterity](Dexterity.md)
- [Constitution](Constitution.md)
- [Intelligence](Intelligence.md)
- [Wisdom](Wisdom.md)
- [Charisma](Charisma.md)

Ability scores can be improved every time a PC [Levels Up](../Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

Ability scores can take *temporary* damage, which is healed after a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Resting.md#Full%20Rest).

## When to Use Ability Scores

Ability scores are added to [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls). While d20 rolls usually add your ability score. Rolls made with smaller dice (d4-d12) will, in certain circumstances, add half your ability score.

The GM may also call for a particular ability [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) in uncertain situations. The six ability scores are the primary way player character's are mechanically represented in the game, and increasing these (at [Level Up](../Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up)) is the primary way they progress.
