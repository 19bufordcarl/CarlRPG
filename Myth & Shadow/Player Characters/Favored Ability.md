# Favored Ability
New PCs can choose one [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) as part of their [Background](Backgrounds.md).

Whenever you make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 roll) with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md), you may add 3 in addition to your ability score bonus for that roll.

*Ex. If I have a +2 [Dexterity](Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) and it is my favored ability, then my total bonus to [Dexterity](Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) is +5.*
