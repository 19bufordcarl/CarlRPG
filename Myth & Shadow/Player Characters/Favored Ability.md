# Favored Ability

PCs choose one [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) as part of their [Background](Background.md).

You get to add the result of your [Expertise Die](Favored%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) to [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls) made with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md).

## Expertise Die

Your expertise die is determined by your level. When making a [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), you roll both your d20 and your expertise die and add them together (you still add your [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md)).

| Level | Expertise Die |
| ----: | ------------: |
|   1-2 |            d4 |
|   3-4 |            d6 |
|   5-6 |            d8 |
|   7-8 |           d10 |
|    9+ |           d12 |

*The result of the expertise die does not impact whether a roll is a [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md) or [Critical Failure](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md).*
