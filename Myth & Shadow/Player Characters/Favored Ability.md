# Favored Ability

PCs choose one [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) as part of their [Background](Background.md).

You get to add the result of your [Expertise Die](Favored%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) to [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls) made with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md).

## Expertise Die

Your expertise die is determined by your level. When making a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md), roll both your d20 and your expertise die. Add them and your [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to get the **result**.

| Level | Expertise Die |
| ----: | ------------: |
|   1-4 |            d4 |
|   5-8 |            d6 |
|    9+ |            d8 |

*Your expertise die roll does not affect whether your d20 roll is a [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) or [Critical Failure](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).*
