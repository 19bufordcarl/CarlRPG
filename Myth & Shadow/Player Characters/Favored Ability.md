# Favored Ability
New PCs can choose one [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md).

Whenever you make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 roll) with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md), you may double that ability score when determining the bonus to that roll.
