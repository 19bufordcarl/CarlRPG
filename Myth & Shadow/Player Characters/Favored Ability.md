# Favored Ability
PCs choose one [Ability Score](Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) as part of their [Background](Background.md).

You get a +3 bonus to [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls) made with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md).

*Ex. If I have 2 [Dexterity](Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) and it is my favored ability, then my total bonus to [Dexterity](Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) is +5.*
