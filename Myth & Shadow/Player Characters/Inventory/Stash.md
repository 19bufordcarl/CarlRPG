# Stash

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has a stash. A stash can hold any number of items that are no bigger than a chest.

In order to access any item in their stash, a PC must use 1 [Zone](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) of [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) in addition to what using that item would take if it were part of their [Equipment](Equipment.md).

## Encumbrance

If a PC wants to carry something that would not fit in their stash, but is reasonable for them to carry, they are [Encumbered](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Encumbered.md).

*Note: Spells like [Floating Disk](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Floating%20Disk.md) or other magic items to help carry large items.*
