# Equipment

Equipment represents the [Items](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Items.md) that a PC has readily available.

A PC has a number of [Equipment Slots](Equipment%20Slot.md) equal to 5 + [Physical Defense](../Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md).

Items in an [Equipment Slot](Equipment%20Slot.md) count as equipped. Whenever a PC takes an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), they may use one of their equipped items as part of that [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

A PC must use an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to swap an equipped item with an item from their [Stash](Stash.md).
