# Equipment

Equipment represents the [Items](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Items.md) that a PC has readily available.

A PC chooses items to fill each of their slots in their [Equipment Table](Equipment.md#Equipment%20Table).

A PC gains additional *Worn Slots* equal to the lesser of their [Health](../Attributes/Health.md) and [Stamina](../Attributes/Stamina.md).

## Using Equipment

Whenever a PC takes an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), they may use one of their equipped items as part of that [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

A PC must use an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to swap an equipped item with an item from their [Stash](Stash.md).
