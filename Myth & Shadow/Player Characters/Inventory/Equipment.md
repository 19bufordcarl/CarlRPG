# Equipment

Equipment represents the [Items](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Items.md) that a PC has readily available.

A PC has the [Equipment Slots](Equipment%20Slot.md) determined by the [Equipment Table](Equipment.md#Equipment%20Table). They gain an additional *Worn Slot* for each point of [Physical Defense](../Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) they have.

Items in an [Equipment Slot](Equipment%20Slot.md) count as equipped. Whenever a PC takes an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), they may use one of their equipped items as part of that [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

A PC must use an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to swap an equipped item with an item from their [Stash](Stash.md).
