- [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md) and [Recovering](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) FP
- Resisting physical status effects (weather, disease, poison, etc.)
- A requirement for [Light](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor%20Properties/Light%20Armor%20Property.md), [Medium](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor%20Properties/Medium%20Armor%20Property.md), and [Heavy](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md) armors
