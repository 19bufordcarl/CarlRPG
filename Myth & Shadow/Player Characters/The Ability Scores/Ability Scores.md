# Ability Scores

There are 6 ability scores. They cannot go above +10.

- [Strength](Strength.md)
- [Dexterity](Dexterity.md)
- [Constitution](Constitution.md)
- [Intelligence](Intelligence.md)
- [Wisdom](Wisdom.md)
- [Charisma](Charisma.md)

Ability scores can be improved every time a PC [Levels Up](../Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

## When to Use Ability Scores

Ability scores are added to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls). They are sometimes added to other rolls, and often times rolls made with smaller dice (d4 to d12) will add [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your ability score.

The six ability scores are the primary way PC's are mechanically represented in the game, and increasing these (usually at [Level Up](../Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up)) is the primary way they progress.
