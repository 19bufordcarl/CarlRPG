# Ability Scores

There are 6 ability scores.

- [Strength](Strength.md)
- [Dexterity](Dexterity.md)
- [Constitution](Constitution.md)
- [Intelligence](Intelligence.md)
- [Wisdom](Wisdom.md)
- [Charisma](Charisma.md)

Ability scores can be improved when a PC [Levels Up](../Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up).

At [Level](../Progression/Level.md) 1, you choose one ability as your [Primary Ability](../Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md).

A PC's ability scores cannot go above 10 by normal means.

## When to Use Ability Scores

Ability scores are added to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls). They are sometimes added to other rolls, and sometimes [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their value is used to determine other bonuses.

*The six ability scores are the primary way PC's are mechanically represented in the game, and increasing these is the primary way they progress.*
