# Intelligence

Abbreviated as **INT**

A character's intelligence represents how adept they are at memorization, mathematics, and grammar. Some applications of intelligence are:

- Your [Mental Defense](../Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) for [Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md)
- Increases [Spell Memorization](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) and [Learned Domains](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md)
- Creating a [Spell Book](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Book.md)
- [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md)
- Reading and writing (PCs with negative intelligence are illiterate)
- [Stabilizing](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Stabilized.md) downed PCs without magic

Other use cases according to GM discretion may also use [Intelligence]().
