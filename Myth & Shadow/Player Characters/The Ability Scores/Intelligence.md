# Intelligence

Abbreviated as **INT**

A character's intelligence represents how adept they are at memorization, mathematics, and grammar. Some applications of intelligence are:

- The [Intelligence Discipline](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md)
	- *The most versatile magical discipline*
- Creating a [Spell Book](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Book.md)
- [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md)
- Reading and writing (PCs with negative intelligence are illiterate)
- [Stabilizing](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Stabilized.md) downed PCs without magic

Other use cases according to GM discretion may also use [Intelligence]().
