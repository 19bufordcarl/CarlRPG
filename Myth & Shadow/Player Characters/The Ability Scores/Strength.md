- Your [Fatigue Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) (FP)
- Your wearable [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md)
- [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) with the [Thrown Property](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Thrown%20Property.md)
- [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) with the [Heavy X Property](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Heavy%20X%20Property.md)
