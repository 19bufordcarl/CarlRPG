# Attribute Scores

There are 3 attribute scores:

- [Health](Health.md)
- [Stamina](Stamina.md)
- [Magicka](Magicka.md)

Attribute scores can be improved when a PC [Levels Up](../Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up).

## When to Use Attribute Scores

Attribute scores are often added to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls). They are sometimes added to other rolls, and sometimes [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their value is used to determine other bonuses.

Sometimes, you may be allowed to add one of your [Skills](../Skills/Skills.md) proficiency bonus to the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).
