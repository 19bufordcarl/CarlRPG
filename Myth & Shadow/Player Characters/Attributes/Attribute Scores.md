# Attribute Scores

There are 3 attribute scores:

- [Health](Health.md)
- [Stamina](Stamina.md)
- [Magicka](Magicka.md)

Attribute scores can be improved when a PC [Levels Up](../Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up).

At [Level](../Progression/Level.md) 1, you choose one as your [Primary Ability](../Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md).

## When to Use Attribute Scores

Attribute scores are often added to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls). They are sometimes added to other rolls, and sometimes [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their value is used to determine other bonuses.

*The three ability scores are the primary way PC's are mechanically represented in the game, and increasing these is the primary way they progress.*
