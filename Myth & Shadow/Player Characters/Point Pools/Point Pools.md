# Point Pools

Point pools are the common resource that PCs use to perform various actions. There are 3 primary point pools that will grow as PCs grow in power. [Health Points](Health%20Points.md), [Magicka Points](Magicka%20Points.md), and [Stamina Points](Stamina%20Points.md).

## Increasing Pool's Points

There are 2 ways that PCs increase their point pools. The first is at [Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md), you get 30 points to distribute amongst your 3 pools as you see fit. The second is at [Level Up](../Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up) you get 15 points to distribute amongst your 3 pools, but no more than 10 of these can go into any single pool.
