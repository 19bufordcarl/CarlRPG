# Magicka Points (MP)

MP represent a your amount of remaining arcane energy.

## Max MP

Your Max MP starts at 0 and is increased at [Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md) and [Level Up](../Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up).

## Current MP

Your current MP, referred to as just MP, ranges from 0 to your Max MP.

Your current MP is changed by [Damage](#Damage) or [Healing](#Healing).

## Usage

Whenever you take damage:

- You subtract it from your HP.
- If the damage meets or exceeds [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your Max HP, you become [Wounded](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).
- If your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md).

*Creatures can be [Resistant](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Resistant.md), [Vulnerable](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Vulnerable.md), or [Immune](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to certain [Damage Types](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) and [Damage Tiers](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/{Damage%20Tiers}.md).*

## Recovery

You can take a [Break](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md) to restore a [Quarter](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) of your Max MP.

[Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md) and magic can heal HP more quickly.

## Miscellaneous

If multiple effects would increase a creature's Max MP, only the stronger effect is used.

Objects may be given MP to represent how magical they are.
