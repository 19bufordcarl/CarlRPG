# Temporary Health Points

Certain effects may grant a creature temporary [Health Points](Health%20Points.md). These [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) live in a separate pool from actual HP.

## Lose Temporary Health Points First

If you have Temporary Health Points and take damage, those points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your [Health Points](Health%20Points.md). For example, if you have 5 Temporary Health Points and take 7 damage, you lose those points and then lose 2 Health Points.

## Duration

Temporary Health Points last until they are depleted or the effect that grants them ends.

## They Don't Stack

Temporary Health Points can't be added together. If you have Temporary Health Points and receive more
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 Temporary Health Points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

## They're Not Health Points or Healing

Temporary Health Points can't be added to your Health Points, healing can't restore them, and receiving
Temporary Health Points doesn't count as healing. Because Temporary Health Points aren't Health Points, a creature can be at full Health Points and receive Temporary Health Points.

If you have 0 Health Points, receiving Temporary Health Points doesn't restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you.
