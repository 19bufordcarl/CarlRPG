# Item Slot

An item slot is used as the unit of abstraction of [Carry Weight](Carry%20Capacity.md) for the purpose of making managing inventory streamlined and enjoyable for gameplay.

Something that takes up an item slot weighs about 5 pounds or is about as big as a bike helmet.

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. Common examples are:

- 10 of certain [Items](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Items.md) (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
- 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
- 500 [Coins](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Coins.md)
	- (Always [Rounding](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Rounding) down means the first 500 takes up 0 slots)
- 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Magic/Mythril.md) powder
	- (Goes with coins in your "pouches" slot)
