# Item Slot

An item slot is used as the unit of abstraction of [Carry Weight](Carry%20Capacity.md) for the purpose of making managing inventory streamlined and enjoyable for gameplay.

An item slot is something that either

1. Weighs around 5 pounds **OR**
2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are

1. 10 of certain [Gear](../../Items/Standard%20Gear.md) (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
2. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
3. 500 [Coins](../../Economy/Coins.md)
	1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
4. 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Magic/Mythril.md) powder
	1. (Goes with coins in your "pouches" slot, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
