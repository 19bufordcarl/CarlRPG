# Physical Defense (PD)

A PC's *Physical Defense* is equal to the [Median](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of their [Strength](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md).

When a *Physical Defense* [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) is made, a PC may add their [Expertise Die](../Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) if their [Primary Ability](../Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md) is [Strength](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), or [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md).
