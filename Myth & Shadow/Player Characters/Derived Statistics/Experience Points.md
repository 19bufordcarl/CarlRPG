# Experience Points (XP)

Experience Points represent the PCs progression throughout the game.

## Milestone XP

At the end of a session, the *Party* rolls 1d3 to determine their XP gained.

When a PC has 10 XP, they can [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up). Their XP then resets to 0.

Whenever the *Party* achieves a *Milestone*, each PC gains 1d3 XP â€” rolled together.

### Determining Milestones

Follow this process to determine whether a task counts as a milestone.

- The players or the GM suggest a goal.
- The GM decides whether that goal is worthy of being a milestone.
- The GM works with the players to break a big goal into smaller milestones.
- The GM adds something to a smaller goal to make it a worthy milestone.
- Milestones should get harder at higher levels.

### Example Milestones

*Low Level*
- *Survive your first combat encounter.*
- *Enter your first dungeon.*
- *Kill the Giant Rat eating all the food in the cellar of The Singing Swine Tavern.*

*High Level*
- *Slay the Vampire Nurilon in the Ruins of Alkencheft.*
- *Retrieve the Ankh of Saint Krenvot from the Tomb of the Underking.*
- *Destroy the Gem of Undying Manifolds beneath Castle Dowyr.*
- *Convince the Dragon Qozsiroth to spare the village of Calm Springs.*
