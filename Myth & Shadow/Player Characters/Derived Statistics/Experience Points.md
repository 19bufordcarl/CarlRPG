# Experience Points

Experience Points ([XP](Experience%20Points.md)) represents the PCs progression throughout the game.

There are two primary methods the GM can use to award XP. [Gritty XP](Experience%20Points.md#Gritty%20XP) and [Story XP](Experience%20Points.md#Story%20XP).

# GM XP Methods

## Gritty XP

When using Gritty XP, the GM announces when the party earned [XP](Experience%20Points.md). All the PCs gain that [XP](Experience%20Points.md).

A PC *can* [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) when they have XP equal to 10 times Current PC [Level](Level.md).

PCs need to [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) during [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime). After PCs [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), their XP resets to 0.

### Treasure XP

PCs gain XP when they obtain treasure. The amount of XP depends on the quality of the treasure.

#### Normal Treasure

A normal treasure is 1 XP.

- Any mundane item that is worth *at least* 1000 coins is a normal treasure.
- Any magical item that is worth *strictly less* than 1000 coins is a normal treasure.

#### Rare Treasure

A rare treasure is 3 XP.

- Most magical treasure is considered a rare treasure.
- (1000-25000 coins roughly speaking)

#### Mythic Treasure

A mythic treasure is 10 XP.

- Any magical treasure that is especially powerful (25,000+) is a mythic treasure.
	- Generally, there is at most 1 mythic treasure reward per quest / dungeon.
- For 'priceless' treasure (1,000,000+), the PCs gain enough XP to gain a [Level](Level.md).
	- Any excess XP is applied to the next [Level](Level.md) as well.
	- These should be once-in-a-campaign type items, world shaping artifacts.

### Combat XP

PCs gain XP when they defeat creatures in [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md).

A defeated creature (defeat includes breaking [Morale](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Morale.md)) grants XP equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](Level.md).

### Narrative Explanation Of Gritty XP

PCs get XP primarily by exposure to ancient magic. This is what allows them to gain [Abilities](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) so much faster than, say, a fighter practicing on training dummies.

### Expected Wealth By Level

The below table spells out the expectation for the wealth of a PC at a given [Level](Level.md). Alternatively, you can use net wealth as the requirement to [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) in place of XP.

|      PC Level | Net Wealth |
| ------------: | ---------: |
|             0 |        100 |
|             1 |      1,000 |
|             2 |     10,000 |
|             3 |     20,000 |
|             4 |     40,000 |
|             5 |    100,000 |
|             6 |    200,000 |
|             7 |    400,000 |
|             8 |  1,000,000 |
|             9 |  2,000,000 |
|            10 |  3,000,000 |
| Higher Levels | +1 million |

## Story XP

*Optional Rule*
The GM awards 1-5 XP at the end of the session based on how successful the party was that session, however this campaign defines success.

A PC *can* [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) when they have 10 XP. The GM can adjust the amount of XP required to level up to different levels if they so desire for pacing purposes.
*Ex. Surviving PCs level up to 2 after session 1, and then proceed leveling normally.*

PCs need to [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) during [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime). After PCs [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), their XP resets to 0.

The GM may require that PCs need to complete a 'quest' prior to leveling up to certain levels.
*Generally levels 5, 7, 9, and 10 would be the 'quest' levels.*

The following guidelines apply to the GM when granting XP.

- 5 XP is reserved for especially impactful sessions.
- 3-4 XP is how much a good session usually grants the party.
- 2 XP should be for sessions where the party did a lot of wheel spinning.
- 1 XP should be reserved for sessions where basically nothing happened.
	- This may be a sign to talk to your group about their enjoyment of the game.
- Alternatively, the GM can use dice to determine XP rewards (d3+1 is recommend).

This method allows flexibility around leveling up and puts the GM more in charge of pacing.
