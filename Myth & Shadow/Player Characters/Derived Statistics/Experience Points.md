# Experience Points (XP)

Experience Points represent the PCs progression throughout the game.

There are two primary methods the GM can use to award XP. [Gritty XP](Experience%20Points.md#Gritty%20XP) or [Milestone XP](Experience%20Points.md#Milestone%20XP).

# GM XP Methods

## Gritty XP

When using Gritty XP, the GM announces when the party earned [XP](Experience%20Points.md). All the PCs gain that [XP](Experience%20Points.md).

A PC can [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) when they have XP equal to 10 times Current PC [Level](Level.md).

After PCs [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), their XP resets to 0.

### Treasure XP

PCs gain XP when they obtain treasure. A treasure grants XP dependent on its value in coins.

|      Coin Value | XP Granted |
| --------------: | ---------: |
| Less than 1,000 |          0 |
|     1,000-5,000 |          1 |
|          5,000+ |        1d6 |
|       Priceless |         10 |

### Combat XP

PCs gain XP when they defeat creatures in [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md). A defeated creature grants XP equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](Level.md). A creature can only grant XP once in its existence. *Breaking [Morale](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Morale.md) is defeating.*

### Expected Wealth By Level

The below table spells out the expectation for the wealth of a PC at a given [Level](Level.md).

|      PC Level | Net Wealth |
| ------------: | ---------: |
|             0 |        100 |
|             1 |      1,000 |
|             2 |     10,000 |
|             3 |     20,000 |
|             4 |     40,000 |
|             5 |    100,000 |
|             6 |    200,000 |
|             7 |    400,000 |
|             8 |  1,000,000 |
|             9 |  2,000,000 |
|            10 |  3,000,000 |
| Higher Levels | +1 million |

## Milestone XP

*Variant*
At the end of a session, the *Party* rolls 1d3 to determine their XP gained.

When a PC has 10 XP, they [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up). Their XP then resets to 0.

Whenever the *Party* achieves a *Milestone*, each PC gains 1d3 XP â€” rolled together.

### Milestones

The GM decides what constitutes a milestone and makes it known to the players beforehand. The players should make suggestions about what goals and milestones they want to work towards. Milestones should, on average, get harder to do at higher levels.

*Some example milestones*

*Low Level*
- *Survive your first combat encounter*
- *Enter your first dungeon*
- *Kill the Giant Rat eating all the food in the caves under The Singing Swine Tavern*

*Higher Level*
- *Slay the Vampire Nurilon in the Ruins of Alkencheft.*
- *Retrieve the Ankh of Saint Krenvot from the Tomb of the Underking.*
- *Destroy the Gem of Undying Manifolds beneath Castle Dowyr.*
- *Convince the Dragon Qozsiroth to spare the village of Calm Springs.*

This method allows flexibility around leveling up and puts the GM more in charge of pacing.
