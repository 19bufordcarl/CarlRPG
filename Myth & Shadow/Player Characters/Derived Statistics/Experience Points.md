# Experience Points

Experience Points ([XP](Experience%20Points.md)) represents the PCs progression throughout the game.

The GM announces when a PC gets [XP](Experience%20Points.md). It is recommended each PC in the group gets the same number of [XP](Experience%20Points.md) in a session.

How the GM awards [XP](Experience%20Points.md) is up to them (objectives achieved, coins retrieved, monsters killed) all can work well.

# GM XP Methods

## Classic Method (Campaign Games)

### General Rules for Gaining XP

- All PCs in the party gain XP together.
- A PC *can* [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) when they have XP equal to 10 x Current PC [Level](Level.md).
	- You need to [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) over [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime).
	- After they [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), a PCs XP resets to 0.

## Treasure XP

### Normal Treasure

- A normal treasure is 1 [XP](Experience%20Points.md).
	- Any mundane item that is worth at least 1000 coins is a normal treasure.
	- Any magical item that is worth strictly less than 1000 coins is a normal treasure.

### Rare Treasure

- A rare treasure is 3 [XP](Experience%20Points.md).
	- Most magical treasure is considered a rare treasure.
		- (1000-25000 coins roughly speaking)

### Mythic Treasure

- A mythic treasure is 10 [XP](Experience%20Points.md).
	- Any magical treasure that is especially powerful (25000+) is a mythic treasure.
		- Generally, there is at most 1 mythic treasure reward per quest / dungeon.
	- For 'priceless' treasure (1,000,000+), the PCs gain enough XP to gain a [Level](Level.md).
		- Any excess XP is applied to the next [Level](Level.md) as well.
		- These should be once-in-a-campaign type items, world shaping artifacts.

## Combat XP

- Defeated creatures (includes breaking [Morale](../../Social%20Systems/Morale%20System.md)) grant XP equal to [Half](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) their [Level](Level.md).

## Narrative Explanation

PCs get XP primarily by passively absorbing magic. This is what allows them to gain [Abilities](../Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) so much faster than, say, a fighter practicing on training dummies. Making your own spell scrolls or potions does not count as finding magic items, you already have that magic.

## Session Method (Story Games)

*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
This optional XP rule is as follows. It is better suited for less lethal games.
- The GM awards 1-5 XP at the end of the session based on how successful the party was that session, however this campaign defines success.
	- XP rewards of 3 or 4 should be how much a competent group usually gets.
	- 5 XP is reserved for especially impactful sessions
	- 1 XP is reserved for the party's worst defeats.
	- This allows flexibility of what success for a given party looks like and puts the GM and players on the same page for how close they are to leveling up.
	- This also removes any fuss over minor XP squabbles since it happens at the end of the session and is easily calculated.
- PCs level up at 10 XP and resets to 0.
- XP should get harder to acquire as PCs get to higher levels.
- Levels 5 and up may require PCs to complete a 'quest' to Level Up.

There is an argument to be made that we learn more from our failures than our successes. While this is true, the behavior a game rewards is the behavior a game encourages, and we don't want the PCs to be trying to fail, it makes for a bad story and a bad game.
