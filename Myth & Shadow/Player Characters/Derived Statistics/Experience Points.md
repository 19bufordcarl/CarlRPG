# Experience Points (XP)

Experience Points represent the PCs progression throughout the game.

There are two primary methods the GM can use to award XP. [Gritty XP](Experience%20Points.md#Gritty%20XP) or [Milestone XP](Experience%20Points.md#Milestone%20XP).

## Gritty XP

When using Gritty XP, the PCs can gain [Treasure XP](Experience%20Points.md#Treasure%20XP) and [Combat XP](Experience%20Points.md#Combat%20XP).

A PC can [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) when they have XP equal to 10 times Current PC [Level](Level.md).

After PCs [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), their XP resets to 0.

### Treasure XP

PCs gain XP when they obtain treasure. A treasure grants XP dependent on its value in coins.

|      Coin Value | XP Granted |
| --------------: | ---------: |
| Less than 1,000 |          0 |
|     1,000-2,000 |          1 |
| More than 2,000 |        1d4 |
|       Priceless |         10 |

### Combat XP

PCs gain XP when they defeat creatures in [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md). A defeated creature grants XP equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](Level.md). A creature can only grant XP once in its existence. *Breaking [Morale](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Morale.md) is defeating.*

### Expected Wealth By Level

The below table spells out the expectation for the wealth of a PC at a given [Level](Level.md).

|      PC Level | Net Wealth |
| ------------: | ---------: |
|             0 |        100 |
|             1 |      1,000 |
|             2 |     10,000 |
|             3 |     20,000 |
|             4 |     40,000 |
|             5 |    100,000 |
|             6 |    200,000 |
|             7 |    400,000 |
|             8 |  1,000,000 |
|             9 |  2,000,000 |
|            10 |  3,000,000 |
| Higher Levels | +1 million |

## Milestone XP

*Variant*
At the end of a session, the *Party* rolls 1d3 to determine their XP gained.

When a PC has 10 XP, they can [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up). Their XP then resets to 0.

Whenever the *Party* achieves a *Milestone*, each PC gains 1d3 XP â€” rolled together.

### Determining Milestones

Follow this process to determine whether a task counts as a milestone.

- The players or the GM suggest a goal.
- The GM decides whether that goal is worthy of being a milestone.
- The GM breaks a big goal into smaller milestones.
- The GM adds something to a smaller goal to make it a worthy milestone.
- Milestones should get harder at higher levels.

#### Example Milestones

*Low Level*
- *Survive your first combat encounter*
- *Enter your first dungeon*
- *Kill the Giant Rat eating all the food in the cellar of The Singing Swine Tavern*

*Higher Level*
- *Slay the Vampire Nurilon in the Ruins of Alkencheft.*
- *Retrieve the Ankh of Saint Krenvot from the Tomb of the Underking.*
- *Destroy the Gem of Undying Manifolds beneath Castle Dowyr.*
- *Convince the Dragon Qozsiroth to spare the village of Calm Springs.*
