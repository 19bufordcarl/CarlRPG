# Scars

Whenever a PC gains the [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md) condition, they gain 1 [Scar](Scars.md). A player should change the description of the PC slightly to reflect this scar.

## Max Scar Threshold

If a PC has a number of scars greater than 5 + their [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md), that PC is on [Deaths Door](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deaths%20Door.md).

Scars can only be healed by powerful magic, usually accessible for PCs at around [Level](Level.md) 9.
