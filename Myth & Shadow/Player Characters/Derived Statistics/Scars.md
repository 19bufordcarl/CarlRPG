# Scars

Whenever a PC gains the [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md) condition, they gain 1 [Scar](Scars.md). A player should change the description of the PC slightly to reflect this scar.

## Max Scar Threshold

If a PC has a number of scars greater than 5 + their [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md), they are at [Deaths Door](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deaths%20Door.md).

Scars can only be healed by powerful magic ([5th Level Spells](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md)).
