# Stash

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has a stash. A stash can hold any number of items that are no bigger than a chest. In order to access any item in their stash, a PC must use an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

## Carrying Large Items

A PC can use a [Hand Cart](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/25%20Coins/Hand%20Cart.md) to carry larger items.
*There are also spells like [Floating Disk](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Floating%20Disk.md) and magic items that help carry stuff.*
