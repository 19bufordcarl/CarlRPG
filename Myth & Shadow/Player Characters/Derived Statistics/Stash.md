# Stash

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has a stash. A stash can hold any number of items that are no bigger than a chest.

In order to access any item in their stash, a PC must use an additional [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) compared to what using that item would take if it were part of their [Equipment](Equipment.md).

## Carrying Large Items

A PC can use a [Hand Cart](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/25%20Coins/Hand%20Cart.md), a [Floating Disk](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Floating%20Disk.md), or other magic items to help carry large items.
