# Mental Defense (MD)

A PC's *Mental Defense* is equal to the [Median](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of their [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md).

When a *Mental Defense* [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) is made, a PC may add their [Expertise Die](../Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) if their [Primary Ability](../Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md) is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), or [Charisma](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md).

*Mental Defense is primarily used for [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) related [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md)*.
