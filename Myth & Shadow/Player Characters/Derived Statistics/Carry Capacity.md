# Carry Capacity

This game uses an [Item Slot](Item%20Slots.md) system. An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management.

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has 10 [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md).

Worn items such as clothing and [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md) do not take up any slots. But, [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) and [Ammo](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) do.
*The sheathes for weapons and ammo are assumed to be part of an adventuring pack.*

## Attempting to Overcarry

A PC can use a [Hand Cart](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/25%20Coins/Hand%20Cart.md) to gain an additional 10 item slots.
*There are also spells like [Floating Disk](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Floating%20Disk.md) and magic items that help carry stuff.*

### Improvised Handcarts and Boxes

A PC can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item. This box-like item can hold up to 5 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) + [Strength](../Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) worth of [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md) in weight / size.

While carrying this "box", PCs are [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md) if [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md) starts.

PCs can carry this "box" for a number of [Delve Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) equal to twice their [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). After that, they gain the [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
