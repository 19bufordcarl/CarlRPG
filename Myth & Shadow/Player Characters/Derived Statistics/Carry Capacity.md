# Carry Capacity

This game uses an [Item Slot](Item%20Slots.md) system (think Minecraft). An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. 

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items/Equipment/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has 10 [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md). 

An item slot is something that 
	1. Weighs about 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

If a PC wishes to carry more than can fit in their pack, then they can get a cart, wagon, horse, or similar item. See [Standard Gear](../../Items/Equipment/Standard%20Gear.md). 

While a PC is [Delving](../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md), they can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item (or a hand cart) of weight less than 50 + (25 * [Strength](../Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md)). While carrying this box, you considered surprised for all [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Initiative.md) rolls.
- If this box is less than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry the box indefinitely. (So you could [Overland Journey](../../Game%20Procedures/Overland%20Journeys.md) with it).
- If the box if greater than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry this box for a number of delve [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) equal to twice your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md).

Worn items such as clothing and [Armor](../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) do not take up any slots. [Weapons](../../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) and ammo do.
	The sheathes for your weapons and quivers for your ammo become part of your pack.
