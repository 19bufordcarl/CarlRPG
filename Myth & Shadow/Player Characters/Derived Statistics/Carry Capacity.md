# Carry Capacity

This game uses an [Item Slot](Item%20Slots.md) system (think Minecraft). An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management.

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has 10 [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md).

Worn items such as clothing and [Armor](../../Items/Armor.md) do not take up any slots. But, [Weapons](../../Items/Weapons.md) and [Ammo](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) do.

- *The sheathes for your weapons and ammo are assumed to be part of your pack.*

## Attempting to Overcarry

A PC can use a [Hand Cart](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/25%20Coins/Hand%20Cart.md) to gain an additional 10 item slots. (There are also spells like [Floating Disk](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Floating%20Disk.md), and there are magic items that might help with this).

### BUT I NEED TO CARRY THIS THING

A PC can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item up to (5 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) + [Strength](../Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md)) [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md) in weight / size. While carrying this box, they are [Surprised](../../Conditions/Surprised.md) if [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md) starts.

- You can carry this box for a number of delve [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) equal to twice your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md).
	- After that you gain the [Exhausted](../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition, and cannot carry any extra stuff again until you [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
