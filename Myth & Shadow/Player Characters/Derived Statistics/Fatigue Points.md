# Fatigue Points

**Your Max FP is Equal to [Level](Level.md) + [Strength](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) + [Dexterity](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)**

*For FP, treat any negative ability scores as 0.*

Fatigue Points (FP) are your pool of combat experience, skill, and endurance. When you take damage, you reduce any FP you have before you reduce your [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) (HP).

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP.

FP regenerates quickly. You can take 6 minutes to [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) 1d4 + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) FP.

*After a [Short Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest), you can restore all your FP (no rolling required).*

# Narrative Reasoning

*Damage to FP represents surface wounds that PCs take. A small cut, a heavy hit to their shield, etc. These are superficial wounds that characters with sufficient physical prowess can brush off easily.*
