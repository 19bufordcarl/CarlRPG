# Fatigue Points

##### Your max FP is equal to [Level](Level.md) + [Strength](../Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) + [Dexterity](../Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)
*Do NOT add negative ability scores to this.*

Fatigue Points (FP) represent your pool of combat experience, skill, and endurance. When you take damage, you reduce any FP you have before you reduce your [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) (HP).

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP. 

FP regenerates quickly, PCs can use a [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) (6 minutes) to [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md#Recover) 1d4 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) FP.

After a [Short Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest) (1 hour) for you can restore all your FP (no rolling required).

*Damage to FP represent surface wounds that PCs take. A small cut, a heavy hit to their shield, superficial wounds that characters with sufficient physicality can brush off easily.*
