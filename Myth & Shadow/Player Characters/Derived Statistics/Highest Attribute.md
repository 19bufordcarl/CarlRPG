# Highest Attribute

The highest of a creature's [Attribute Scores](../Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) receives a bonus to its [Spell Resist DC](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md) [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

A creature can only have one highest attribute, if there is a tie, pick one that makes more sense. If the creature is a PC, use the highest point pool. If there is still a tie, the PC must decide which one will be the highest whenever this tie occurred (usually at time of level up).
