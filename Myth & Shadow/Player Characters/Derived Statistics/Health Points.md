# Health Points (HP)

# Hit Points (HP)

**Your Max HP is Equal to 5 + [Level](Level.md) + [Strength](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) + [Dexterity](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)**

Hit Points (HP) represent a mix of your combat skill, endurance, and physical health.

## How HP Works

Your current HP ranges from 0 to your *Max HP* and can be affected by damage or healing.

Whenever you take damage, you subtracted it from your current HP.

When your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md) and you gain a [Scar](Scars.md).

You can take 6 minutes to [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) 1d4 + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) HP.

## Old Mechanics

When you take damage, you reduce [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) (FP) before you reduce HP.

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP.

When your HP is restored, any additional restoration past your **Max HP** is applied to your FP.

HP does *NOT* regenerate naturally. Magical resources must be used to restore it.

*Objects may be given HP to represent how tough they are.*
