# Health Points

**Your Max HP is Equal to Your 5 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)**

Health Points (HP) represent your physical health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Conditions/Dying.md) and you gain a [Scar](Scars.md). *There is no [Negative HP](Health%20Points.md#Negative%20HP).*

When you take damage, you reduce [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) before you reduce HP.

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP.

HP regenerates slowly. After a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest), you can restore 1 HP.

# Object HP

Inanimate objects can be given an HP value to represent how hard they are to destroy.

# Negative HP

This game does *not* have negative HP. If your HP would be reduced to below 0, it is simply 0.
