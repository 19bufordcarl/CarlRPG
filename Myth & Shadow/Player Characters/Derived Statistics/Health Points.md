# Health Points

**Your Max HP is Equal to 5 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)**

Health Points (HP) represent your physical health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Conditions/Dying.md) and you gain a [Scar](Scars.md). *There is no [Negative HP](Health%20Points.md#Negative%20HP).*

When you take damage, you reduce [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) (FP) before you reduce HP.

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP.

When your HP is restored, any additional restoration past your **Max HP** is applied to your FP.

HP does *NOT* regenerate naturally. Certain resources, such as potions or herbs, may restore it.

# Object HP

Creatures always have HP, but objects may be given HP to represent how tough they are.

# Negative HP

This game does *NOT* have negative HP. If your HP would be reduced to below 0, it is simply 0.
