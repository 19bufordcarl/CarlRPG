# Health Points

##### Your max HP is equal to your 10 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)

Health Points (HP) represent your physical health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Conditions/Dying.md) and you gain a [Scar](Scars.md).

When you take damage, you reduce [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) before you reduce HP.

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP.

HP regenerates slowly, after a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest), you can restore 1 HP.
## Object HP
Inanimate objects can be given an HP value to represent how hard they are to destroy.
