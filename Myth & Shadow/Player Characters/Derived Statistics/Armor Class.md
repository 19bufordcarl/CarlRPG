# Armor Class
**A creature's AC is determined by their worn [Armor](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md).**

A creature's AC is a particular type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) used for [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) rolls.
- [Melee Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) that fail to meet the AC do not deal damage.
	- The [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md#Melee%20Bash) reaction will let you do limited damage on a miss still.
- [Ranged Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) that fail to meet the AC do not deal damage.
	- For things that explode on contact, a roll of 10 or more "hits" the target but did not penetrate their armor.
	- Rolls less than 10 miss the target outright.

*An unarmored creature's AC is equal to 10.*
