# Armor Class

**A creature's AC is determined by their worn [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md).**

A creature's AC is a particular type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) used to defend against incoming [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) rolls. If an attack roll fails to meet the AC, it is a "miss" and damage is blocked. A successful attack is a "hit".

An unarmored creature's AC is equal to 10.
