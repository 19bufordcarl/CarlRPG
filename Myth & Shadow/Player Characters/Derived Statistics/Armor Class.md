# Armor Class

**A creature's AC is determined by their worn [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md).**

A creature's AC is a particular type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) used for [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) rolls. If such an attack roll fails to meet the AC, it is called a "miss" and does not deal damage. A successful attack is a "hit".

When relevant, the following rules apply:

- For attacks where contact is important, a roll of 10 or more that "misses" represents an attack that "contacts" the target but was blocked somehow (armor, shield, parry, etc.)
- Rolls less than 10 represent attacks that missed the target outright.

*An unarmored creature's AC is equal to 10 unless otherwise noted.*
