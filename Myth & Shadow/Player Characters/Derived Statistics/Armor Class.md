# Armor Class

**A creature's AC is determined by their worn [Armor](../../Items/Armor.md).**

A creature's AC is a particular type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) used for [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) rolls.

- [Melee Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) that fail to meet the AC do not deal damage.
	- A [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash) lets creatures do reduced damage on a miss.
- [Ranged Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) that fail to meet the AC do not deal damage.

When relevant, the following rules apply:

- For attacks where contact is important, a roll of 10 or more that "misses" represents an attack that "hit" the target but was blocked by their armor.
- Rolls less than 10 represent attacks that missed the target outright.
- If the target used the dodge [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md), use 10 + their [Dexterity](../Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) instead.

*For reference, an unarmored creature's AC is equal to 10.*
