# Armor Class
**A creature's AC is determined by their worn [Armor](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md).**

A creature's AC is a particular type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) used for [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) rolls.
- [Melee Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) that fail to meet the AC usually deal half damage.
	- If the roll was a natural 1, they miss
- [Ranged Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) that fail to meet the AC usually deal half damage.
	- If the result was less than 10, they miss

*An unarmored creature's AC is equal to 10.*
