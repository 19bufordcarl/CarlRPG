# Level

A PC level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach the threshold [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md). You can then [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).
## Level Up
By default, levelling up requires 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime) where the PCs are not adventuring, but reflecting on what they have experienced thus far and honing their abilities.

When you level up, you can increase 3 different [Ability Scores](../Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each, or 1 ability score by 2.
- *Don't forget to adjust any relevant derived statistics!*
## Downtime
Activities that state they can be done over a month of downtime can be done while leveling up. 
## NPCs Level
NPCs and monsters also have levels, but they are defined in the referee specific section.

## Fast Leveling
*Optional Rule:*
You can level up over a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) rather than 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime).

Some referees and players may prefer fasting level for campaigns that involve significant time pressure, or as just a general stylistic preference. For these campaigns, it is recommended that the group comes up with a narrative reason for why the party is able to grow so quickly relative to the rest of the world.
