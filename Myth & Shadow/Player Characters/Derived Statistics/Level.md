# Level (LV)

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever they [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), which they may do when they achieve the required [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md).

## Level Up

Levelling up requires [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime) where the PCs are not adventuring, but reflecting on what they have experienced thus far and honing their abilities.

When you level up you get **three** [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) increases. You cannot use these to increase an [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) to be greater than your [Level](Level.md) plus one.

## Downtime

Downtime is time spent by PCs not adventuring. They may be traveling on a ship, building a homebase, researching, crafting, or otherwise honing their skills to level up.

Activities that state they can be done over downtime can be done while leveling up.

The GM decides how long downtime will be as determined by the pacing of the campaign. For more episodic games, 1-6 months of downtime provides ample spacing for the PCs to have their own lives separate from adventuring. For campaigns with more urgency, downtime might only be a day or a week.

## Max Level

Level 10 is the max level for a PC.
