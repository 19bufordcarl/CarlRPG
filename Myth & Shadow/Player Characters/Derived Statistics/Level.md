# Level
A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach the threshold [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md). You can then [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).
## Level Up
By default, levelling up requires 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime) where the PCs are not adventuring, but reflecting on what they have experienced thus far and honing their abilities.

When you level up, you can increase 3 *different* [Ability Scores](../Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each.
- Don't forget to adjust any relevant derived statistics!
- *Optional Rule: (You **can** teach an old dog new tricks)*
	- *You may increase the same ability score multiple times so long as the resulting score is less than or equal to your level.*
	- *Ex. If I am leveling up from 3 to 4, and my Wisdom is 1, I could put all three points in Wisdom to get it up to a 4. This can help PCs who want to change direction.*
## Downtime
Activities that state they can be done over a month of downtime can be done while leveling up. 
## Max Level
By default, 10 is the max level for a PC. You can in theory keep going and just keep increasing ability scores, but it is generally expected for the PCs story to be over by then.
## NPCs Level
NPCs and monsters also have levels, but they are simply defined in their stat block.

## Fast Leveling
*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
You can level up over a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) rather than 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime).

Some GM's and players may prefer faster level for campaigns that involve time pressure, or as just a stylistic preference. For these campaigns, it is recommended that the group comes up with a narrative reason for why the party is able to grow so quickly relative to the rest of the world.
