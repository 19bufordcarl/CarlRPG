# Level

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach the threshold [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md). You can then [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).

## Level Up

By default, levelling up requires 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime) where the PCs are not adventuring, but reflecting on what they have experienced thus far and honing their abilities.

When you level up:

- If to an even level:
	- You can increase 2 *different* [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each.
- If to an odd level:
	- You can increase 3 *different* [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each.

### Multiple Ability Score Increases

You may increase the same [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) multiple times when leveling up, so long as the resulting score is less than or equal to your level.

*Ex. If I am leveling up from 3 to 4, I get 2 increases. Say my Wisdom is 2. I can put both increases in Wisdom to get it up to a 4. This can help PCs who want to change direction.*

## Downtime

Downtime is time spent by PCs not adventuring. They may be traveling on a ship, building a homebase, researching, crafting, or otherwise honing their skills to level up.

Activities that state they can be done over a month of downtime can be done while leveling up.

## Max Level

By default, 10 is the max level for a PC. The GM may create their own rules for higher level play.

## NPCs Level

NPCs (any creature that is not a PC) also have levels, but they are simply defined in their stat block.
