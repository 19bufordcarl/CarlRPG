# Level (LV)

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever they [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), which they may do when they achieve the required [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md).

## Level Up

When you level up you get **three** [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) increases. You cannot use these to increase an [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) to be greater than your [Level](Level.md) plus one.

Levelling up may require [Downtime](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) depending on the campaign pacing.

## Max Level

Level 10 is the max level for a PC.
