# Level

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach the threshold [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md). You can then [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).

## Level Up

Levelling up requires [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime) where the PCs are not adventuring, but reflecting on what they have experienced thus far and honing their abilities.

When you level up:

- If reaching an even level:
	- You can increase 2 **different** [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each.
- If reaching an odd level:
	- You can increase 3 **different** [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each.

### Multiple Ability Score Increases

You may increase the same [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) multiple times when leveling up, so long as the resulting score is less than or equal to your level.

*Ex. If I am leveling up from 3 to 4, I get 2 increases. Say my Wisdom is 2. I can put both increases in Wisdom to get it up to a 4. This can help PCs who want to change direction.*

## Downtime

Downtime is time spent by PCs not adventuring. They may be traveling on a ship, building a homebase, researching, crafting, or otherwise honing their skills to level up.

Activities that state they can be done over downtime can be done while leveling up.

The DM decides how long downtime will be as determined by the pacing of the campaign. For more episodic games, 1-6 months of downtime provides ample spacing for the PCs to have their own lives separate from adventuring. For campaigns with more urgency, downtime might only be a day or a week.

## Max Level

Level 10 is the max level for a PC. The GM may create their own rules for higher level play.

## NPCs Level

NPCs also have levels, but they are simply defined in their stat block.
