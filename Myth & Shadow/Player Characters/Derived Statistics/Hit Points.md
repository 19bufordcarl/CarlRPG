# Hit Points (HP)

## Max HP

Your *Max HP* is equal to 5 + 2 x ([Level](Level.md) + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md))

Hit Points represent a mix of your combat skill, endurance, and physical health.

Your current HP, referred to as just HP, ranges from 0 to your *Max HP*.

Your HP is affected by damage or healing.

## Damage

Whenever you take damage:

- You subtract it from your HP.
- Make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Physical Defense](Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) or become [Wounded](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).
- If your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md).

*Creatures can be [Resistant](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Resistant.md), [Vulnerable](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Vulnerable.md), or [Immune](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to certain [Damage Types](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).*

## Healing

You can take a [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) 1d4 + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) HP.

Many [Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md) and other magic can heal HP more quickly.

## Miscellaneous

Objects may be given HP to represent how tough they are.
