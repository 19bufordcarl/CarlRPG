# Hit Points (HP)

## Max HP

Your *Max HP* is equal to 5 + [Level](Level.md) + [Physical Defense](Physical%20Defense.md) + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md).

## How HP Works

Hit Points represent a mix of your combat skill, endurance, and physical health.

Your current HP ranges from 0 to your *Max HP* and can be affected by damage or healing.

Whenever you take damage, you subtracted it from your current HP. You then make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) where XX is the amount of damage taken. On a failure, you are [Wounded](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

When your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md), are [Wounded](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md), and gain a [Scar](Scars.md).

You can take a [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover) 1d4 + [Constitution](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) HP. Magic can heal HP more quickly.

*Objects may be given HP to represent how tough they are.*
