### Tox'ra [Ancestry](Ancestry.md) (Lore)
*The Lizardfolk refer to themselves as Tox'ra, or 'Of the Tree'. They have an unfortunate plight in a world dominated by humans and elves. Their alien appearance to them is used to justify treating like beasts and monsters by many. Most Lizardfolk call the Xar’lith jungle home, a place poorly documented by imperial scribes with legends of gigantic lizards larger than windmills.*

*Lizardfolk culture is much more gender fluid and less hierarchical than the rest of the Imperial cultures. In the pockets of Lizardfolk civilization that remain, such as Krik’ras, they are highly egalitarian and value freedom and self determination.*
