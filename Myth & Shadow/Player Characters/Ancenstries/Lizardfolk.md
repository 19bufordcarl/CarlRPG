## Tox'ra [Ancestry](Ancestry.md) (Lore)

*The Lizardfolk refer to themselves as Tox'ra, or 'Of the Tree'. The Tox'ra have an unfortunate plight in a world dominated by humans and elves. Most call the Xar'lith (Living Forest) home. It is poorly documented by imperial scribes; there are legends of gigantic lizards larger than windmills.*

*Lizardfolk culture does not have clear gender roles or hierarchies when compared to other Imperial cultures. In the pockets of Lizardfolk civilization that remain, such as Tox'lith (Tree of Life), they are highly egalitarian and value freedom and self determination.*
