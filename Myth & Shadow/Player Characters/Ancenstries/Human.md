### Human [Ancestry](Ancestry.md) (Lore)
*The most common ancestry. They are as diverse as they are adaptable. The Ardes Empire is seated in the Capitol City of Imperia.*

*The most defining feature of modern Human culture is the Empire. Mastering naval navigation has led them to dominate the control of resources throughout the world, increasing their influence and power over all other cultures and nations, much to those people's dismay.* 

*Other cultures tend to distrust humans due to the Empire, including some subcultures of humans.*

*Author's Note:*
*I have left the subcultures of humans undefined because I believe that this is likely what the GM will want to fill out for their local area to give it a unique feel. Just remember that Human culture is not a monolith.*
