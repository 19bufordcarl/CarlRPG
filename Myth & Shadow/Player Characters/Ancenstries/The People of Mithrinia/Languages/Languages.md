# Languages

Virtually all [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) speak common as at least a second language.

All PCs speak common. A PC may learn a new language over [Downtime](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) if it makes sense for the narrative of the character and the campaign.
