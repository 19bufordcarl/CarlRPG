# Subcultures Lore

*Elves are the longest living [Ancestry](../Ancestry.md) in Mithrinia. There are a wide variety of subcultures of elf across, but there are three primary categories.*

## Forest Elf (Sylvan)

*Forest Elves (Sylvan) typically stay secluded in their forest kingdom of Glynwyn. They are famed for having wise scholars and powerful druids and mages due to their long life spans. They are often perceived as being snobby. They have complex internal politics due to old powerful families. The Sylvan Order is the primary overseeing body and values living harmoniously with nature, which their society generally does quite well, they revere [Silvanus](../../../Magic/Deities/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Mithrinian%20Deities/Silvanus.md) and the [Sylvan Pantheon](../../../Magic/Deities/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Sylvan%20Pantheon.md).*

*Forest Elven culture tends to value harmony and balance above all else, and views the Empire as an affront to said balance.*

## Ash Elf (Cendraeri)

*Known as Ash Elves, it is a translation into common from their tongue, where they call themselves "Cendraeri" literally "Ones Reborn from Ash". The volcanic Raven Ridge mountains have crafted mighty warriors through fire. Most Ash Elves still speak their dialect of Elvish in formal settings, they value tradition very highly.*

*Their creation myths say that they were once a tribe of forest elves, who were saved by great prophets that learned from the almighty [Nyx](../../../Magic/Deities/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Mithrinian%20Deities/Nyx.md). They believe Nyx blessed them with glorious forms and red eyes, as well as superior strength and intellect.*

*The temple of Nyx is the primary political force in Raven Ridge, they oversee the great houses. The great houses are powerful families whose members are supposedly the descendants of the original prophets of Nyx, and they control most of the land of Raven Ridge. The internal politics between the leadership of the great houses and the core temple leadership has become incredibly fraught at times, but externally they have always maintained a united front.*

*Cendraeri culture tends to value family, honor, and power. They dislike the Empire because it threatens their independence.*

## Deep Elf (Orc)

*Most Orcs reside in the mountain kingdoms of Cragstone; home to some of the finest warriors and blacksmiths in the Empire. Orcs remain a people divided however, there are some orcish cults that follow the perverse teachings of [Oroken](../../../Magic/Deities/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Mithrinian%20Deities/Oroken.md). Most orcs, however, despise Oroken, the chief adversarial Deity in their religion. Their religion claims that he is the cause of their curse. Gaera is the Deity that most orcs follow, being at home in the Cragstone mountains and deep caves, they find her teachings of strength and loyalty to the earth to be most fitting to their culture.*

*In the Orcish creation myth, they were once a clan of elves who were deceived by another clan of elves; Oroken worshippers. These elves cast a foul curse on them, shortening their lives and causing them to grow pig-like features, tusks chief among them. Orcs have lifespans akin to humans rather than the long lives of the other elves, but they retained their quick healing of injuries.*

*Orcish culture holds a great deal of respect for the Empire as it values might and authority highly.*
