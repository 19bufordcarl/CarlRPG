##  (Sylvan)

*Forest Elves (Sylvan) typically stay secluded in their forest kingdom of Glynwyn. They are famed for having wise scholars and powerful druids and mages due to their long life spans. They are often perceived as being snobby. They have complex internal politics due to old powerful families. The Sylvan Order is the primary overseeing body and values living harmoniously with nature, which their society generally does quite well.*

*Forest Elven culture tends to value harmony and balance above all else, and views the Empire as an affront to said balance.*

## Ash Elf (Cendraeri)

*Known as Ash Elves, it is a translation into common from their tongue, where they call themselves "Cendraeri" literally "Ones Reborn from Ash". The volcanic Raven Ridge mountains have crafted mighty warriors through fire. Most Ash Elves still speak their dialect of Elvish in formal settings, they value tradition very highly.*
