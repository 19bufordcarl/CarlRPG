# Ancestry
Ancestries are the different fantasy species of intelligent humanoids, what other systems might call humans and demi-humans. The default setting of Myth & Shadow has the following ancestries.

- [Human](Human.md)
- [Elves](Elves.md)
	- Forest, Ash, and Deep (Orc)
- [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)

## Ancestry Abilities
Are designed to be minimal and only represent the essential magical component of the ancestry.
## Languages
By default, all Ancestries are assumed to speak common, language translation between different cultures is not a common feature of the default setting, it is better for the desired gameplay if everyone can understand everyone. 
### Knowing Languages
If the referee plans language to come up in game, then the following should apply. Each ancestry has an ancient language that their scholars would know for historical texts. You can know a number of ancient languages equal to your intelligence at character creation (you need not know the language of your ancestry).
