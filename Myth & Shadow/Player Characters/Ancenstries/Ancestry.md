# Ancestry

Ancestries are the different fantasy species of intelligent [Humanoids](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md). Ancestries are split into two components: game mechanics and lore. GMs may change the lore to suit the campaign.

## Mechanics

Players can choose one of the following mechanical bonuses for their ancestry:

1. [Nonmagical](Mechanical/Nonmagical.md) (Default)
2. [Ancient](Mechanical/Ancient.md)
3. [Aquatic](Mechanical/Aquatic.md)
4. [Avian](Mechanical/Avian.md)
5. [Hardy](Mechanical/Hardy.md)
6. [Keen](Mechanical/Keen.md)

## Ancestry Abilities

Ancestries only confer physiological benefits. Any knowledge or skills that belonging to a specific culture might grant you is handled by the [Background](../Backgrounds/Background.md) mechanic.

Virtually all people in the Mithrinian Empire speak at least a basic level of common.

There are many [Languages](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) that have developed across ancestries.
