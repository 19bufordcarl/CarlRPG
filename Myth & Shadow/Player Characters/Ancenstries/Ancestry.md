# Ancestry

Ancestries are the different fantasy species of intelligent [Humanoids](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md). Ancestries are split into two components. There is the mechanical component which determines what special abilities the ancestry grants, and there is the lore, which describes how that ancestry fits into the setting.

## Mechanics

The core mechanical ancestries players can choose from are:

1. [Ancient](Mechanical/Ancient.md)
2. [Nonmagical](Mechanical/Nonmagical.md)
3. [Primal](Mechanical/Primal.md)

If you desire to play with ancestries beyond those known to be part of the world of Mithrinia, the player simply chooses whichever mechanical ancestry is closest to their desire.

## Ancestry Abilities

Ancestries are designed to only confer physiological benefits. Any knowledge or skills that belonging to a specific culture might grant you is handled by the [Background](../Backgrounds/Background.md) mechanic.

## The People of Mithrinia

The world of Mithrinia has the following ancestries.

1. [Humans](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Humans.md)
2. [Elves](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md)
3. [Dwarves](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Dwarves.md)
4. [Smallfolk](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Smallfolk.md)
5. [Lizardfolk](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Lizardfolk.md)
6. [Birdfolk](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Birdfolk.md)
7. [Catfolk](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Catfolk.md)
8. [Rabbitfolk](The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Rabbitfolk.md)

The vast majority of the population are Humans, followed by Elves. The various animal folk are overall quite rare and make up a small portion of the population.

### Languages

Virtually all people in the Mithrinian Empire speak at least a basic level of common.

Whenever you increase your [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) to an even number, you may learn a new language.
