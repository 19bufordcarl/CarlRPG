## Ancestry Abilities

Are designed to be minimal and only represent the magical component of the ancestry. Any knowledge that belonging to a specific culture might grant you is handled in your [Background](../Backgrounds/Background.md).

## Languages

All people in the Mithrinian Empire speak common.

### Knowing Languages

If the GM plans language to come up in game, then the following should apply: If your [Favored Ability](../Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) from your [Background](../Backgrounds/Background.md) is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you may have learned up to 2 languages prior to character creation (you need not know the language of your ancestry).
