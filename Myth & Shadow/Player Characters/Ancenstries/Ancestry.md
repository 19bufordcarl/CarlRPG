# Ancestry
Ancestries are the different fantasy species of intelligent humanoids, what other systems might call humans and demi-humans. The default setting of Myth & Shadow has the following ancestries.

By default, all Ancestries are assumed to speak common, language translation between different cultures is not a feature of the default setting, it is simpler for gameplay if everyone can understand everyone. Additional, each ancestry has an ancient language that their scholars would know for historical texts.
