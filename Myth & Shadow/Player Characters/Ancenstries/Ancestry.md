# Ancestry
Ancestries are the different fantasy species of intelligent humanoids, what other systems might call humans and demi-humans. The default setting of Myth & Shadow has the following ancestries.

- [Human](Human.md)
- [Elves](Elves.md)
- [Orcs](Orcs.md)
- [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
- [Infernals](Infernals.md)

## Ancestry Abilities
By default, all PCs just get the generic [Lucky](Ancestry.md#Lucky) ability, they aren't assumed to have any special ability

A PC can design their own ability based on the particular type and culture their character came from, ancestries are not a monolith. The referee chooses whether to allow the mechanical benefit proposed by the player, or they can get the [Lucky](Ancestry.md#Lucky) default ability. The mechanical benefit should not be noticeably stronger than lucky, but lucky is quite good.
### Lucky
Once per dawn, you can Reroll a natural 1 on any [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) you make. Only affects PCs.
## Languages
By default, all Ancestries are assumed to speak common, language translation between different cultures is not a common feature of the default setting, it is better for the desired gameplay if everyone can understand everyone. 
### Knowing Languages
If the referee plans language to come up in game, then the following should apply. Each ancestry has an ancient language that their scholars would know for historical texts. You can know a number of ancient languages equal to your intelligence at character creation (you need not know the language of your ancestry).
