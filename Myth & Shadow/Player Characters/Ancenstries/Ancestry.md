# Ancestry

Ancestries are the different fantasy species of intelligent humanoids, what other systems might call humans and demi-humans. The world of Mithrinia has the following ancestries.

- [Human](Human.md)
- [Elf](Elf.md) (Subcultures)
	- Forest (Sylvan)
	- Ash (Cendraeri)
	- Deep (Orc)
- Animalfolk
	- [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
	- 

## Ancestry Abilities

Are designed to be minimal and only represent the essential magical component of the ancestry. Any knowledge that belonging to a specific culture might grant you is handled in your [Background](../Backgrounds/Background.md).

## Languages

All people in the Mithrinian Empire speak common.

### Knowing Languages

If the GM plans language to come up in game, then the following should apply. Each ancestry has an ancient language that their scholars would know for historical texts. If your [Favored Ability](../Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) from your [Background](../Backgrounds/Background.md) is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you may have learned up to 2 ancient languages prior to character creation (you need not know the language of your ancestry).
