### Orcish [Ancestry](Ancestry.md)
*Most Orcs call the mountain kingdoms of Cragstone home. The home of some of the finest warriors and blacksmiths in the Empire. Orcs remain a people divided however, as some still prefer their ancient ways of Viking raids and pillaging.*

*In Orcish myth, they were once a tribe of [Elves](Elves.md) who were deceived by other elves, who led them to be cursed with their tusks and shortened lives. Those who believe this tend to despise Elves.*

*Orcish culture holds a great deal of respect for the Empire as it values might and authority highly.*
