*The Rabbitfolk, or Harensil are rare creatures found in small idyllic villages across the northern forests of Mithrinia. They are quiet and skittish, they tend to keep to themselves and their lovely gardens of fruits and vegetables, but can be accommodating to guests who show kindness and good manners to them.*
