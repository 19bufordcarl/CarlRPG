# Avian

Avian ancestries are [Humanoids](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) with wings of some sort. Avian ancestries have the [Winged](Avian.md#Winged) feature.

# Winged

You have wings on your back that let you fly for short distances. You can fly a distance equal to your normal [Movement](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) on your [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). If you end your turn airborne, you fall to the ground.

# Examples

Most birdfolk and fairy type creatures would count as avian.
