# Nonmagical

Nonmagical ancestries are [Humanoids](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) whose physiology does not grant them any mechanical advantages over that of a normal human. They have the [Lucky](#Lucky) feature.

# Lucky

At the start of each session, you gain a [Reroll Token](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md).

# Examples

Some common fantasy ancestries that would usually be considered nonmagical would be humans and halflings.

*Note: Lucky only applies to PCs*
