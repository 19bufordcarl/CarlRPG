# Ancient

Ancient ancestries are [Humanoids](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) who live very long lives. They are much more healthy and enduring than humans. They have the [Near Immortal](Ancient.md#Near%20Immortal) feature.

## Near Immortal

When you [Recover](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Recover), you cure both [Wounded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md) and [Exhausted](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md).

Also, you cannot contract mundane diseases.

## Examples

Some common fantasy ancestries that would be considered ancient would be elves and dwarves. Orcs often fit in this category too, as they are typically cursed elves that retain their supernatural health, but have shortened overall lifespans.
