# Ancient

*Ancient* ancestries are [Humanoids](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) who live very long lives. They are much more healthy and enduring than humans. They are [Near Immortal](Ancient.md#Near%20Immortal).

## Near Immortal

When you [Recover](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md#Recover), you regain [Half](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Max HP](../../Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md#Max%20HP) and cease being [Wounded](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md) and [Exhausted](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) too.
