# Ancient

Ancient ancestries are [Humanoids](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) who live very long lives. They are much more healthy and enduring than humans. They have the [Near Immortal](Ancient.md#Near%20Immortal) feature.

# Near Immortal

After a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest), your [HP](../../Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is restored to full.

# Examples

Some common fantasy ancestries that would be considered ancient would be elves, gnomes, and dwarves. Orcs would also usually fit in this category, as they are typically cursed elves that retain their healing ability, but have shortened lifespans.
