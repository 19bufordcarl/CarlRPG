# Primal

Primal ancestries are [Humanoids](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) who hail from extreme natural environments, for which they highly adapted. They have the [Adaptive](#Adaptive) feature.

# Adaptive

Choose one of the following based on your ancestral environment:

1. **Aquatic:** You can breathe both air and water and swimming is not [Difficult Movement](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement).
2. **Avian:** You can fly for short distances a time. You can fly with your [Movement](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) on your [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). If you end your turn airborne, you fall to the ground.
3. **Keen Sense:** You cannot be [Surprised](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md) so long as this sense is not impaired.
4. **Resistance:** You are [Resistant](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Resistant.md) to either [Acid](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Acid.md), [Cold](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md), [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md), or [Lightning](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage.
5. **Tough Hide:** Your unarmored [AC](../../Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) is 13.
6. **Nocturnal:** You can see in non-magical [Darkness](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md). *(The [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) is magical)*

# Examples

Some common fantasy ancestries that would be considered primal would be cat folk, lizard folk, draconic folk, bird folk, and devil folk. Orcs from settings where they are not related to elves would also fit in this category.
