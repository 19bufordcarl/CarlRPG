# Making Ancestries
Your can absolutely play Myth & Shadow without Ancestries. Ancestries are always, in my opinion, setting specific.
## Design your own ancestries
If your setting has other fantasy ancestries, then the appropriate details you need are:

- That ancestry's lifespan, physical appearance, language, social context and culture.
- A unique physical trait of that ancestry. Ex: Lizardfolk are amphibious.

You can add additional mechanics but that is not assumed. I recommend against tying ability scores or other traits that any PC could increase as they level up to being an ancestral benefit (i.e. you start with a bonus to X). It’s preferred to have the trait being something entirely unique to that ancestry’s physical / spiritual characteristics.
