# Making Ancestries
Your can absolutely play Myth & Shadow without Ancestries. Ancestries are always, in my opinion, setting specific.
## Design your own ancestries
If your setting has other fantasy ancestries, then the appropriate details you need are:

- That ancestry's lifespan, physical appearance, language, social context and culture.
- Either give them [Lucky](../Human.md#Lucky), or define one unique thing about the ancestry on that level.

You can add additional mechanics but that is not recommended. I recommend against tying ability scores or other traits that any PC could increase as they level up to being an ancestral benefit (i.e. you start with a bonus to X). Itâ€™s preferred to have the trait being something entirely unique to that ancestry regardless of level (i.e. those with gills can breathe water).

I strongly, *strongly*, recommend against "half" ancestries. The idea of half-elves or half-orcs is steeped in some outdated beliefs about racial purity and it's not necessary for a fun game. If you start designing it, I would hope that you would quickly realize that you're building game mechanics around measuring the 'purity of your elven blood' or something like that. What can I say but yikes. There are two solutions to this that I think work well.
1. Ancestries are simply different species, there can of course be relationships between ancestries, but breeding is simply not possible.
2. The offspring of two different ancestries is just the same as one of the parents (whichever you prefer). You can have the aesthetic be a blend of the two, but just pick one for the game mechanic side of it; trust me, you really don't want to go down the rabbit hole of racial purity as a game mechanic.
