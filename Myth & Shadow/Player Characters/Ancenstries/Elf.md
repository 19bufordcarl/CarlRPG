## Subcultures (Lore)
Elves are the oldest creatures in Myth & Shadow, and thus have more varied cultures than the younger and shorter lived [Humans](Human.md) and [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md). They are no mechanical differences, aside from the fact that characters who come from these cultures would know more about them.
### Forest Elf [Ancestry](Ancestry.md)
*Forest Elves typically stay secluded in their forest kingdom of Glynwyn. They are famed for having wise scholars and powerful druids and mages due to their long life spans. They are often perceived as being snobby. They have complex internal politics, and tend to live harmoniously with nature.* 

*Forest Elven culture tends to value harmony and balance above all else, and views the Empire as an affront to said balance.*
### Ash Elf [Ancestry](Ancestry.md)
*Known as Ash Elves, it is a translation into common from their tongue, where they call themselves "Cendraeri" literally "Ones Reborn from Ash". The volcanic Raven Ridge mountains have crafted mighty warriors through fire. Most Ash Elves still speak their dialect of Elvish in formal settings, they value tradition very highly.*

*Their legends say that they were once a tribe of forest elves, whose religious leaders learned from the great [Erevanthe](../../Magic/Spells/Deities/Deity%20Index/Erevanthe.md), a mysterious deity. They believe Erevanthe blessed them with glorious forms and red eyes, as well as superior strength and intellect.*

*Cendraeri culture tends to value family, honor, and power. They dislike the Empire because it threatens their independence.*
### Deep Elf (Orc) [Ancestry](Ancestry.md)
*Most Orcs call the mountain kingdoms of Cragstone home. The home of some of the finest warriors and blacksmiths in the Empire. Orcs remain a people divided however, as some still prefer their ancient ways of Viking raids and pillaging.*

*In Orcish myth, they were once a tribe of forest [Elf](Elf.md) who were deceived by another clan of elves, who led them to be cursed with their tusks and shortened lives; Orcs have lifespans akin to humans rather than the long lives of the other Elves, but they retained their quick healing of injuries.*
- *Orcs who believe this tend to despise Elves.*

*Orcish culture holds a great deal of respect for the Empire as it values might and authority highly.*
