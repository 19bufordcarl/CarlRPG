# Favored Ability

PCs choose one [Ability Scores](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) as part of their [Background](Background.md).

You get to add the result of your [Expertise Die](Favored%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls) made with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md).

## Expertise Die

When making a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with your [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md), roll both your d20 and a d4 (expertise die). Add them together to your [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) to get the **result**.

*Your expertise die roll does not affect whether your d20 roll is a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) or [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).*
