# Primary Ability

PCs choose one [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their *Primary Ability* as part of their [Background](Background.md).

You add the result of your [Expertise Die](#Expertise%20Die) to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls) made with your primary ability.

## Expertise Die

Your expertise die progresses as you [Level](../Progression/Level.md) according to this table:

| Level |  Die | *Optional* Static Bonus Rule |
| ----: | ---: | ---------------------------: |
|     0 | None |                           +0 |
|   1-4 |   d4 |                           +2 |
|   5-9 |   d6 |                           +3 |
|   10+ |   d8 |                           +4 |

The result of the expertise die does not impact if a roll is a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) or [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).

## Minor Boons

If beneficial circumstances arise on a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md), but they aren't quite worthy of d20 [Advantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md), the GM may let a PC roll their [Expertise Die](Primary%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) with [Advantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).
