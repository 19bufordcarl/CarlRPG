# Background

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Primary Skill](Primary%20Skill.md) associated with your background and determines the miscellaneous knowledge the character has.

## Language

You learn 1 [Language](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) from your background besides common, which all PCs know.

If your favored ability is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you learn up to 3 [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md).

## Flavor

Your background can be **whatever you want**, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the campaign and a 1st level. This flavor is used to determine what knowledge your character would have in-world.

A *Scholar* would know a lot about history and recent events, while a *Street Kid* would know who the power players in the undercity are.

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.

*See [Example Backgrounds](Example%20Backgrounds.md).*
