# Background

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose two [Skills](../Skills/Skills.md) to gain [Proficiency](../Skills/Skills.md#Proficiency) in.

## Flavor

Your background can be **whatever you want**, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the campaign and a 1st level character. This flavor can help the GM determine how NPCs react to you and generally how your character fits into the world.

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.

*See [Example Backgrounds](Example%20Backgrounds.md).*
