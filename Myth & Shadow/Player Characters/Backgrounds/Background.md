# Background

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) associated with your background and determines the miscellaneous knowledge the character has.

## Flavor

Your background can be whatever you want, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the campaign. This "flavor" is used to determine what knowledge your character would have. A **scholar** would know a lot about history, while a **street kid** would know who the power players in the undercity are.

If your favored ability is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you may know up to 2 ancient languages. (See [Ancestry](../Ancenstries/Ancestry.md))

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.
