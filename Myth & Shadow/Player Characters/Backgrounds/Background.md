# Background

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Primary Ability](Primary%20Ability.md) associated with your background and determines the miscellaneous knowledge the character has.

## Language

You learn 1 [Language](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) from your background besides common, which all PCs know.

If your background was in [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you may known up to 3 [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md).

## Flavor

Your background can be **whatever you want**, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the campaign and a 1st level character. This flavor is used to determine what knowledge your character would have in-world.

A *Scholar* would know a lot about history and recent events, while a *Street Kid* would know who the power players in the undercity are.

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.

*See [Example Backgrounds](Example%20Backgrounds.md).*

## Bonuses

If your background fits a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) particularly well, you may roll your [Expertise Die](Primary%20Ability.md#Expertise%20Die) with [Advantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

*Note: A background never fits [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md), [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md), [Physical Defense](../Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md), or [Mental Defense](../Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) rolls particularly well.*
