# Background

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Favored Ability](Favored%20Ability.md) associated with your background and determines the miscellaneous knowledge the character has.

If your favored ability is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you also learn up to 3 non-common [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md).

## Flavor

Your background can be whatever you want, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the campaign and a 1st level. This "flavor" is used to determine what knowledge your character would have of the world.

A *Scholar* would know a lot about history and recent events, while a *Street Kid* would know who the power players in the undercity are.

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.
