# Background

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Mechanically, this let's you choose one [Primary Skill](Primary%20Skill.md) associated with your background and determines the miscellaneous knowledge the character has.

## Language

You learn 1 [Language](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) from your background besides common, which all PCs know.

If your favored ability is [Intelligence](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), you learn up to 3 [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md).

## Flavor

Your background can be whatever you want, so long as the GM deems it reasonable for the campaign and a 1st level. This "flavor" is used to determine what knowledge your character would have of the world.

A *Scholar* would know a lot about history and recent events, while a *Street Kid* would know who the power players in the undercity are.

Feel free to make a custom background, or find a random table that you like and roll for one.

Here are some [Example Backgrounds](Example%20Backgrounds.md).

## Unique Thing

It is a good idea to give a character one unique thing as it relates to their place in the campaign world. This shouldn't give any real combat benefit, but could have narrative implications. The GM can veto any backgrounds that would not fit well in the campaign.

As a general rule of thumb to players, remember that your character is starting at first level. They were almost certainly not a dragon rider or some other powerful person. Your character may grow into a legend, if they survive, but we want to have story at the table, not before it.
