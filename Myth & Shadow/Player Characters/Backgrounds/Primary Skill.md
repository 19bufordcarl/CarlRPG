# Primary Skill

PCs choose one [Ability Score](../The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) to be their [Primary Skill](Primary%20Skill.md) as part of their [Background](Background.md).

You add the result of your [Expertise Die](#Expertise%20Die) to [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) (d20 rolls) made with your [Primary Skill](Primary%20Skill.md).

## Expertise Die

Your expertise die progresses as you [Level](../Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) according to this table:

| Level |  Die |
| ----: | ---: |
|     0 | None |
|   1-4 |   d4 |
|   5-9 |   d6 |
|   10+ |   d8 |

The result of the expertise die does not impact if a roll is a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) or [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).
