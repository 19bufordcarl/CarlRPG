Abbreviated as **CON**

A character's constitution represents much physical endurance and fortitude they have. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use constitution.

- How many [Health Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) you have
- How many [Fatigue Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) you have
- How many [Scars](../Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) you can have before being at [Death's Door](../../Conditions/Death's%20Door.md)
- [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md) effectively and recovering [Fatigue Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md)
- Resisting physical effects (cold, disease, poison, acid, etc.)
- A requirement for [Medium](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Medium%20Armor%20Property.md) and [Heavy](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md) armors
- Traveling long distances without getting [Exhausted](../../Conditions/Exhausted.md)

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to GM discretion may also use **CON**
