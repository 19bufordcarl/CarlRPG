# Constitution

Abbreviated as **CON**

Your constitution represents your physical endurance. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use constitution.

- How many [Fatigue Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) you have
- How many [Health Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) you have 
- Traveling long distances
- [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md) effectively 
- Resisting physical effects (cold, disease, poison, acid, etc.)
- A requirement for [Armors](../../Items/Armor.md) with the [Constitution X Property](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Constitution%20X%20Property.md)
- How many [Scars](../Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) you can have before being at [Death's Door](../../Conditions/Death's%20Door.md)

If a creature's [Constitution](Constitution.md) would be decreased below -10, it [Dies](../../Conditions/Dying.md#Dead).

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **CON**
