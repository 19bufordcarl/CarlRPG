# Dexterity

Abbreviated as **DEX**

A character's dexterity represents how much physical speed and precision they have as well as their skill in ranged combat. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use dexterity.

- [Ranged Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) and damage
- How many [Fatigue Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) you have
- [Weapons](../../Items/Weapons.md) with the [Expertise X Property](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Expertise%20X%20Property.md)
- [Weapons](../../Items/Weapons.md) with the [Finesse Property](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Finesse%20Property.md)
- The dodge [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)
- Moving stealthily
- Sleight of hand tasks (Pickpocketing, Lock-picking, etc.)
- [Variable Speed](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md#Variable%20Speed) (unless using abstract distance)

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to GM discretion may also use **DEX**
