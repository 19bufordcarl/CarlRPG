# Wisdom

Abbreviated as **WIS**

A character's wisdom represents how good they are at perceiving and intuiting the world around them as well as their mental willpower. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use wisdom.

- The [Wisdom Discipline](../../Magic/The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Wisdom%20Discipline.md) for [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting.md)
- Maintaining [Concentration](../../Magic/Concentration.md)
- The number of [Trained Animals](../../Items/Trained%20Animals.md) you can have at a time
- Resisting non-physical magic effects
- How perceptive you are

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to GM discretion may also use **WIS**
