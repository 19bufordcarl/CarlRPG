# Wisdom

Abbreviated as **WIS**

A character's wisdom represents how good they are at perceiving and intuiting the world around them as well as their mental willpower. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use wisdom.

- Resisting non-physical magic effects
- How many [Fatigue Points](../Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) you have
- Maintaining [Concentration](../../Magic/Concentration.md)
- Certain [Deities](../../Magic/Spells/Deities/Deities.md) allow their followers to use their Wisdom for [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) instead of [Intelligence](Intelligence.md)
- Perception

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **WIS**
