# Intelligence

Abbreviated as **INT**

A character's intelligence represents how adept they are at memorization, mathematics, and grammar. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use intelligence.

- The classic [Spellcasting Discipline](../../Magic/Spellcasting/The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md)
- Creating [Spell Scrolls](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Scrolls.md)
- Reading and writing (PCs with negative intelligence are illiterate)

Other use cases according to GM discretion may also use [Intelligence](Intelligence.md).
