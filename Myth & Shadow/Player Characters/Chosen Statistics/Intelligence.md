# Intelligence

Abbreviated as **INT**

A character's intelligence represents how good they are at memorization based mental skills. By default, magic is a memorization based skill. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use intelligence.

- [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) (And thus [Old School Alchemy](../../Magic/Alchemy/Old%20School%20Alchemy.md) and [Enchanting Procedures](../../Magic/Enchanting/Enchanting%20Procedures.md))
- Determines [Max Spell Level](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level)
- Determines [Max Spell Memorization](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Memorization.md#Spell%20Memorization)
- [Spell Scrolls](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Scrolls.md)
- Reading and writing (players with negative intelligence are illiterate)

Other use cases according to GM discretion may also use [Intelligence](Intelligence.md).
