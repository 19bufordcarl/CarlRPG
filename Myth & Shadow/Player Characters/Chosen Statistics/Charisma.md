- The [Morale](../../Social%20Systems/Morale%20System.md) of your [NPC Hirelings](../../Social%20Systems/NPC%20Hirelings.md)
- The number of [Trained Animals](../../Items/Trained%20Animals.md) you can have at a time
- [Monster Reactions](../../Social%20Systems/Monster%20Reactions.md) from random encounters
