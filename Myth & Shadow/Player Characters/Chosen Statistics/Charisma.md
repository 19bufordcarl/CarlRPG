# Charisma

Abbreviated as **CHA**

A character's charisma represents how much connection they have to other living creatures, mentally and spiritually. The following [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) and systems use charisma.

- Number of [Trained Animals](../../Items/Trained%20Animals.md) you can have at a time
- [Monster Reactions](../../Social%20Systems/Monster%20Reactions.md) from some random encounters
- [Morale](../../Social%20Systems/Morale%20System.md) of your enemies and [NPC Hirelings](../../Social%20Systems/NPC%20Hirelings.md)
- [Social Reactions](../../Social%20Systems/Social%20Reactions.md) and skills (persuade, deceive, intimidate, perform, impress, etc.)
- Certain [Deities](../../Magic/Deities/Deities.md) allow their followers to use their [Charisma](Charisma.md) for [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) instead of [Intelligence](Intelligence.md)
- [Companions](../../Social%20Systems/Companions.md) (non-default rule)

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **CHA**
