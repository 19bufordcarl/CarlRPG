*Ability scores are added to rolls in appropriate circumstances. Rolls made with a d20 usually add twice your ability score. Rolls made with smaller dice (d4-d12) might add your ability score or half your ability score depending. Damage rolls use half your ability score by default.*

*Common circumstances for adding the score are spelled out on that ability scores rules text. The referee may also call for a particular ability roll given the situation. These ability scores are the primary way your character is mechanically represented in the game, and changing these is the primary way you can see your character progress.*
