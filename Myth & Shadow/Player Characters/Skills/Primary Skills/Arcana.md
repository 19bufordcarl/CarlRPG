# Arcana

The *Arcana* [Skill](../Skills.md) governs all abilities related to [Spells](../../../Magic/Spells.md), magic, and lore knowledge.

It directly impacts [Known Spells](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md), [Spellcasting](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md), and [Crafting Magic Items](../../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md).

It also lets you learn [Languages](../../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) at [Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md) or over [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).

Whenever you gain a tier of this skill, you may *Master* one of your [Known Spells](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md) (see [Forceful Spellburn](#Forceful%20Spellburn)). You may also learn one [Exotic Language](../../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md#Exotic%20Languages) of your choice.

## Forceful Spellburn

If you do not have enough [Magicka Points](../../Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) for the [Magicka Point Cost](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Magicka%20Point%20Cost.md), you can expend great effort to transfuse some of your remaining [Health Points](../../Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) into [Magicka Points](../../Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) temporarily.

To do so, you take [Tier 3](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Necrotic](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage equal to double the number of [Magicka Points](../../Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) you would need to have meet the [Magicka Point Cost](../../../Magic/Spellcasting/Magicka%20Point%20Cost.md) for the spell. If this damage reduces your [Health Points](../../Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) to 0, you [Die](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md#Dead) instantly.

You may only use *Forceful Spellburn* for [Spells](../../../Magic/Spells.md) you have *Mastered*.
