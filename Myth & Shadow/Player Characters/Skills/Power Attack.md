# Power Attack

A *Power Attack* is a special kind of [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) that PCs trained in the appropriate [Melee Combat](Primary%20Skills/Melee%20Combat.md) can perform.

Whenever you make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md), you can choose to spend [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) to turn it into a power attack. If the stamina point consumption roll exceeds your current [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), your consume all your [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), but you do not deal the additional damage.

There are two options for tables. You may choose **any** of the options in the table so long as you meet the weaponry proficiency tier requirement. You can choose to take the average [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) consumption once you reach tier 5 or higher in this skill.

## Notes

*The PC can flavor their power attack however their desire for their character concept. A high level ranged specialist might say that they hurl of a volley of arrows one after the other at blinding speed, while a raging berserker might say they crush their foes limbs with their massive hammer.*
