# Skills

Skills are used to represent the category of frequently taken actions that require the PC has relevant training and experience in order to be successful.

There are two types of skills. [Primary Skills](Skills.md#Primary%20Skills) and [Secondary Skills](Skills.md#Secondary%20Skills).

## Primary Skills

Primary Skills represent the core [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md) abilities that a PC has and generally they will only specialize in one or maybe two primary skill.

- [Arcana](Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md)
- [Melee Combat](Primary%20Skills/Melee%20Combat.md)

## Secondary Skills

Secondary Skills represent more out of combat expertise and are more common to have PCs where they are slightly experienced in many different skills.

- [Finesse](Secondary%20Skills/Finesse.md)
- [Speechcraft](Secondary%20Skills/Speechcraft.md)
- [Survival](Secondary%20Skills/Survival.md)

## Proficiency

PCs gain one tier for one [Primary Skill](Skills.md#Primary%20Skills) and one [Secondary Skill](Skills.md#Secondary%20Skills) at [Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md).

A PC cannot increase a [Proficiency Tier](Skills.md#Proficiency%20Tiers) to be higher than their [Level](../Progression/Level.md).

### Skill Points

Whenever a PC gains a [Level](../Progression/Level.md), they gain *Skill Points* which they can spend to increase the [Proficiency Tiers](Skills.md#Proficiency%20Tiers) of their skills, which grants an increased proficiency bonus at levels 1, 5, 9, etc. It may also confer other benefits detailed for the skill.

It costs a number of skill points equal to increase a tier. You can only increase a tier one step at a time. *For example, if my Arcana skill is at tier 3, it would cost me 4 points to get it to tier 4.*

### Proficiency Tiers

| Tier | Skill Point Cost | Proficiency Bonus |
| ---: | ---------------: | ----------------: |
|    0 |                0 |                +0 |
|    1 |                1 |                +2 |
|    2 |                2 |                +2 |
|    3 |                3 |                +2 |
|    4 |                4 |                +2 |
|    5 |                5 |                +3 |
|    6 |                6 |                +3 |
|    7 |                7 |                +3 |
|    8 |                8 |                +3 |
|    9 |                9 |                +4 |
|   10 |               10 |                +4 |
| etc. |             etc. |              etc. |

If [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) specifies any skills, you may add your proficiency bonus to the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) if applicable.

Sometimes, you will receive significant penalties if you attempt a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) without proficiency.

### Max Proficiency Bonus

The maximum proficiency bonus as a function of a PC's [Level](../Progression/Level.md) is thus:

| Level | Max Proficiency Bonus |
| ----: | --------------------: |
|     0 |                    +0 |
|   1-4 |                    +2 |
|   5-8 |                    +3 |
|  9-12 |                    +4 |
|  etc. |                  etc. |
