# Skills

Skills are used to represent the category of frequently taken actions that require the PC has relevant training and experience in order to be successful.

There are two types of skills. [Primary Skills](Skills.md#Primary%20Skills) and [Secondary Skills](Skills.md#Secondary%20Skills).

## Primary Skills

Primary Skills represent the core [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md) abilities that a PC has and generally they will only specialize in one or maybe two primary skill.

- [Arcana](Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md)
- [Weaponry](Primary%20Skills/Weaponry.md)

## Secondary Skills

Secondary Skills represent more out of combat expertise and are more common to have PCs where they are slightly experienced in many different skills.

- [Finesse](Secondary%20Skills/Finesse.md)
- [Speechcraft](Secondary%20Skills/Speechcraft.md)
- [Survival](Secondary%20Skills/Survival.md)

## Proficiency

PCs gain one tier for one [Primary Skill](Skills.md#Primary%20Skills) and one [Secondary Skill](Skills.md#Secondary%20Skills) at [Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md).

At [Level](../Progression/Level.md) 5, PCs can increase the tier of two of these skills by 1 each.

At [Level](../Progression/Level.md) 9, PCs can increase the tier of two of these skills by 1 each.

### Proficiency Tiers

| Tier | Proficiency Bonus |
| ---: | ----------------: |
|    0 |                +0 |
|    1 |                +2 |
|    2 |                +3 |
|    3 |                +4 |
| etc. |              etc. |

If [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) specifies any skills, you may add your proficiency bonus to the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) if applicable.

Sometimes, you will receive significant penalties if you attempt a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) without proficiency.
