# Weaponry

The *Weaponry* [Skill](Skills.md) encompasses all abilities around martial arts and the use of [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md).

It also governs other related combat skills like unarmed attacks and wielding [Shields](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20Property.md).

## Power Attacks

Whenever you make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md), you can choose to spend [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) to turn it into a power attack. The options available to you are determined by the following table. If the stamina point consumption roll exceeds your current [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), you do not deal the additional damage.

|                         +2 |               2d6 (7) |               1d6 |

|                       etc. |                  etc. |              etc. |

## Stamina Recovery

Whenever you hit with an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and choose not to make a power attack, you regain [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) as determined by your weaponry proficiency.

| Weaponry Proficiency Bonus | SP Recovered |

|                         +2 |         2d20 |
