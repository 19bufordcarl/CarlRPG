# Weaponry

The *Weaponry* [Skill](Skills.md) encompasses all abilities around martial arts and the use of [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md).

It also governs other related combat skills like unarmed attacks and wielding [Shields](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20Property.md).

## Power Attacks

Whenever you make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md), you can choose to spend [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) to turn it into a power attack. If the stamina point consumption roll exceeds your current [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), your consume all your [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md), but you do not deal the additional damage.

There are two options for tables. You may choose any of the options in the table so long as you meet the weaponry proficiency bonus requirement. You can choose to take the average [Stamina Points](../Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) consumption once you reach a bonus of +3 or higher in this skill.
