# Artisanry

The *Artisanry* [Skill](../Skills.md) governs all abilities related to crafting fine items with tools.

This impacts [Basic Alchemy](../../../Magic/Crafting/Basic%20Alchemy.md), [Crafting Magic Items](../../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md), [Weapon Oils](../../../Magic/Crafting/Weapon%20Oils.md).

It also governs your ability to craft wholly mundane items.
