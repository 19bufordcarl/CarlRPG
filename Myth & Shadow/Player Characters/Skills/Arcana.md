# Arcana

The *Arcana* [Skill](Skills.md) governs all abilities related to magic and lore knowledge.

It directly impacts [Known Spells](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md), [Spellcasting](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md), and [Crafting Magic Items](../../Magic/Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md).

It also lets you learn [Languages](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) at [Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md) or over [Downtime](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).

Whenever you gain a tier of this skill, you may *Master* one of your [Known Spells](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md) (see [Forceful Spellburn](Arcana.md#Forceful%20Spellburn)). You may also learn one [Language](../Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) of your choice.

## Forceful Spellburn

If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you may force it to be a success, unless it was a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).

To do so, you take [Tier 3](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Necrotic](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage equal to the difference of failed [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and the [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md).

If this damage reduces your [Health Points](../Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) to 0, you [Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md#Dead) instantly.

You may only use *Forceful Spellburn* for [Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md) you have *Mastered*.
