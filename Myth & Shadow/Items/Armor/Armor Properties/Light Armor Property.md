# Light Armor Property

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

## Requirements

In order to wear [Armor](../Armor.md) with this property, you must have non-negative [Strength](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) and [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md).

### Lack of Requirements

If you do not meet the requirements, you have [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

## Don / Doff

Light Armor takes 1 minute (10 [Combat Rounds](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round)) to don / doff.

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor Class](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) unless the item states otherwise.
