# Mythril Materials
Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can hold the strongest [Enchantments](../../Magic/Enchanting/Enchanting.md).
## Mythril Weapons
Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons.md) must be constructed from scratch.

- Mythril weapons add +1 to both attack and damage rolls.
	- For ranged weapons, this does stack with improved [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md).
	- [Ranged Weapons](../Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) deal the [Damage Type](../../../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) of their [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md), not the weapon.
- Mythril weapons deal [Mythril Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) instead of [Mundane Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
	- Replace the [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) with the [Mythril Property](Mythril%20Property.md).
- Mythril weapons only take up 1 [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).
- Some creatures cannot be harmed by [Mundane Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) or [Silver Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Silver%20Damage.md).

## Mythril Armor
Mythril armor increases its [Armor X Property](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md) by 1 from [Plate Armor](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Mundane%20Armors/Plate%20Armor.md) for each tier.

Mythril armor must be constructed from scratch
- Use a metallic ([Heavy](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md)) armor as a reference point.
- Mythril armor costs *at least* 100x its normal price.
- The [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) is replaced with the [Mythril Property](Mythril%20Property.md).
- The armor loses the [Heavy Armor Property](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Heavy%20Armor%20Property.md).
- The armor reduces its [Constitution X Property](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Constitution%20X%20Property.md) to 1.
- The armor loses the [Strength X Property](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Strength%20X%20Property.md).

*Lore:*
*Mythril metal is of the highest quality, light as cloth and tough as dragon hide. It can hold the strongest magical enchantments.* 

*It is worth ten times its weight in gold; a suit of Mythril armor is worth more than small kingdoms.*
> *"'What?' cried Gimli, started out his silence. 'A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!"*
