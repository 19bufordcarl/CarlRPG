# Mundane Materials

Mundane is the default material for weapons, armor, and other items.

It assumes some combination of steel, dense cloth or leather, and wood as the components for the weapon. For short, this is simply referred to as mundane. These items deal [Mundane Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).

Some creatures cannot be harmed by [Mundane Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
