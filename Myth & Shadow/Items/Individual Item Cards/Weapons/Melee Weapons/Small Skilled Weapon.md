*Throwing Knives Note:*

*Yes I am aware this means dagger / hatchets don't have the thrown property. You can absolutely throw them to try to hit something. It counts as an [Improvised Ranged Weapon](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md#Improvised%20Ranged%20Weapons). The idea that throwing a knife / axe is a valid combat technique is pure fiction. I know this is a fantasy game, but this is the somewhat realistic part, not the magic part.*

*Reality aside, talking game balance purposes, you can't dual wield a thrown weapon.*
