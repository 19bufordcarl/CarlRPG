# Slow
Slow means in order to make a [Ranged Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) with this weapon, you must [Ready](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Combat%20Action) it. Readying an attack means you spend your [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) to gain the attack as [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) until your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md).

*You can make the readied attack at any time, including immediately after you ready it.*
