# Versatile

A Versatile means the weapon is wielded with one handed by default, but gains a benefit if wielded with two hands.

If wielded with two hands, you can add 1 to your [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) rolls (but not damage).

See [Two Handed Property](Two%20Handed%20Property.md).
