# Ammo

Ammo means that the weapon needs a type of ammunition in order to make an [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md). Each attack consumes 1 instance of that ammunition. You need a free hand to reload a weapon with this property, unless that weapon also has the the [Two Handed Property](Two%20Handed%20Property.md).

*You can pick up one piece of used ammunition with an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md). The 3 main types of ammo are [Arrow](../Ammo/Arrow.md), [Bolt](../Ammo/Bolt.md), and [Sling Stone](../Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md). The [Delving Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) [Recover](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md#Recover) lets you pick up all non-destroyed spent ammo.*
