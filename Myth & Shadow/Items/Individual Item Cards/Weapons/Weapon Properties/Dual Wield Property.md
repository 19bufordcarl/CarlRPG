# Dual Wield

A Dual Wield weapon can be wielded in the wielder's off hand.

When the wielder hits with an [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) using the weapon in their main hand, they can end their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) immediately to add the damage die of weapon in their off hand to the damage dealt.
