# Thrown

A Thrown weapon means that the wielder can throw the weapon to make a [Ranged Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md). The wielder *may* substitute all instances of [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) with [Strength](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) for this attack.

*The default range for this attack is 30'.*
