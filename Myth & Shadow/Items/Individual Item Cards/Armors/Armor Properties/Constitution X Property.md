Constitution X means that the wearer needs at least X [Constitution](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). If they don't, they gain the [Exhausted](../../../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)).
