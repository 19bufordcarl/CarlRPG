# Armor X
Armor X is the main property of all [Armor](../../../Armor.md) sets.

Your [Armor Class](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) is equal to X.

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor X Property](Armor%20X%20Property.md) unless the item states otherwise.

### Don / Doff
By default, armor takes 1 minute (10 [Combat Rounds](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Combat%20Round)) to don / doff.
Heavy Armor takes 6 minutes (1 [Delve Round](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round)) to don / doff
