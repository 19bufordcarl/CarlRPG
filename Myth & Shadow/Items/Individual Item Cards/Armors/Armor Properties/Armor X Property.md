# Armor X
Armor X is the main property of all [Armor](../../../Armor.md) sets.

While wearing this armor, your [Armor Class](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) is equal to X.

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items (winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example) without affecting the [Armor X Property](Armor%20X%20Property.md) unless the item states otherwise.
