# Shield X
Shield is the main property of all shields.
- Shields require a one free hand to wield.
	- This means they cannot be used with [Two Handed Weapons](../../Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Two%20Handed%20Property.md) or [Spellcasting](../../../../Magic/Spellcasting.md)
- Shields grant the bearer the [Shield Block X](Shield%20X%20Property.md#Shield%20Block%20X) ability.

#### Shield Block X
Shield Block is a [Reaction](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md). 

You may use this reaction after an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) against you is made. 

You raise your [Armor Class](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) by X for the purposes of this attack roll.

*(Reminder that [Reactions](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) can only be used once per [Round](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)).*
