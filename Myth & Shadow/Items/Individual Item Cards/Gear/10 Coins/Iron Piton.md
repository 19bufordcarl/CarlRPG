# Iron Piton

An iron spike with a hole for threading rope.

- Can be hammered into most stone walls
- When rope is threaded through them, this allows creatures to make climbing [Checks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
	- If the wall was already climbable, these [Checks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) have [Advantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md).
