# Armor
## Armor Properties
An Armor's properties determine how exactly the armor behaves.
- #Armor The main property of all armor sets (omitted in the armor sets table for brevity)
	- Armor reduces the amount of damage taken from [[../../Damage Types/Slashing\|Slashing]], [[../../Damage Types/Piercing\|Piercing]], and [[../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning\|Bludgeoning]] by the armor's damage reduction value. 
	- **Worn armor does not take up any [[../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Item Slots\|Item Slots]].**
- #Shield The main property of shields, (omitted in the shield table for brevity)
	- Shields require a one free hand to wield.
	- Shields grant the bearer the [[Armor#Shield Block|Shield Block]] ability.
### Sub Properties
- #Heavy means that the wearer has [[../../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on all [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]], and sinks in water.
	- The wearer can make a [[../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] 30 [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] every 6 second [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]] to not sink.
- #ConstitutionX means that the wearer needs at least X [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution|Constitution]] or they gain the [[../../Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] condition after wearing the armor for 6 minutes (1 delve [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]]).
- #StrengthX means that the wearer needs at least X [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] or they have [[../../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on all [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]], and their [[../../Game Procedures/Movement\|Movement]] speed is halved (rounded down).

#### Shield Block
Shield Block is a [[../../Game Procedures/Reaction\|Reaction]]. When you use this reaction you may attempt to block an incoming attack that deals [[../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning\|Bludgeoning]], [[../../Damage Types/Piercing\|Piercing]], or [[../../Damage Types/Slashing\|Slashing]] damage after the attack [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] is made. To block an incoming attack, the shield bearer makes a [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] with a [[../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] equal to the target's attack [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]]. On a successful block, the bearer reduces one of the stated damage types by an additional 5 to their armor's reduction value. On a failure, damage proceeds as normal. (Reactions can only be used once per [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]]).
## Don / Doff
Normal Armor takes 1 minute (10 combat [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Rounds]]) to don / doff.

Heavy Armor takes 6 minutes (1 delve [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]]) to don / doff.

Shields are treated as normal items, (dropped freely and picked up with 5â€™ of [[../../Game Procedures/Movement\|Movement]]).
