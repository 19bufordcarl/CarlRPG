# Mundane
#Mundane is the default material for weapons. This assumes some combination of steel, dense cloth or leather, and wood as the components for the weapon. For short, this is simply referred to as mundane. Unless otherwise specified, a weapon is assumed to have the #Mundane property.

Some creatures can only be harmed by [[Silvered Property|Silvered]] or [[Mythril Property|Mythril]] weapons.
