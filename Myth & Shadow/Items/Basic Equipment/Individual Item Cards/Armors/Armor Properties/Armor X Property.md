# Armor X
#ArmorX is the main property of all armor sets.
	When you would take [[../../../../../Damage Types/Slashing|Slashing]], [[../../../../../Damage Types/Piercing|Piercing]], or [[../../../../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning|Bludgeoning]] damage, you reduce the damage from that type by X. 

**Worn armor does not take up any [[../../../../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Item Slots|Item Slots]].**

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items, winged boots for example, without affecting the [[Armor Properties/Armor X Property|Armor X Property]] unless the item states otherwise.
