# Mythril
#Mythril means that the armor gains 3 to its [[Armor X Property]].

Mythril weapons must be constructed from scratch.
	Mythril weapons cost 1000 times as much as the base [[Mundane Property|Mundane]] weapon.

Mythril [[../../../Weapons|Weapons]], [[../../../Armor|Armor]], and ammo can hold the strongest enchantments.

Some creatures can only be harmed by [[Silvered Property|Silvered]] or [[Mythril Property|Mythril]] weapons.



*Lore:*
*Mythril metal is of the highest quality, light as cloth and tough as dragon hide. It is more capable of holding magical enchantments.* 

*It is worth ten times its weight in gold; a suit of Mythril armor is worth more than small kingdoms.*
