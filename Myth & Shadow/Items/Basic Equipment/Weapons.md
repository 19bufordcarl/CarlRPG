# Weapons

A weapon is an item that can be used to make an [[../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]]. Doing so allows the user to deal roll the weapon's specified damage die (or dice) and then add any relevant [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Ability Scores|Ability Score(s)]] to get the resulting damage applied from the [[../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]].

See [[Individual Item Cards/Weapons/Weapon Properties/Large X Property|Weapon Properties]] for details on what each property means.

## Sheathes / Quivers
Any weapon you get is assumed to come with the appropriate sheathe and quiver, which is what takes up the [[../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Item Slots|Item Slot]] in your adventurer's pack.


*Throwing Knives Note:*

*Yes I am aware dagger / hatchets don't have the thrown property. You can absolutely throw them to try to hit something. It counts as an improvised [[../../Game Procedures/Ranged Attack\|Ranged Attack]] weapon. The idea that throwing a knife / axe is a valid combat technique is pure fiction. I know this is a fantasy game, but this is the somewhat realistic part, not the magic part.*

*You want to throw your weapon? Use a javelin.*
