# Mythril Materials
Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can hold the strongest [Enchantments](../../../Magic/Enchanting/Enchanting.md).
## Mythril Weapons
Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons.md) must be constructed from scratch.

- Mythril weapons deal an additional +1 damage.
	- For ranged weapons, this does stack with improved [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md).
- Mythril weapons deal [Mythril Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) instead of [Mundane Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).
	- Replace the [Mundane Property](Mundane%20Property.md) with the [Mythril Property](Mythril%20Property.md).
- Mythril weapons only take up 1 [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).

Some creatures cannot be harmed by [Mundane Damage](../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).

Mythril [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) changes the damage type, but only adds a +1 bonus to damage.

*Lore:*
*Mythril metal is of the highest quality, light as cloth and tough as dragon hide. It is more capable of holding magical enchantments.* 

*It is worth ten times its weight in gold; a suit of Mythril armor is worth more than small kingdoms.*
> *"'What?' cried Gimli, started out his silence. 'A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!"*
