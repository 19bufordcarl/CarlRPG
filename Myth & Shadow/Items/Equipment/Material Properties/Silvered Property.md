*Lore:*
*'Silvering' uses a bit of silver and Mythril alloyed with steel, making the metal much lighter, without sacrificing strength. It also becomes capable of holding enchantments. It was supposedly discovered by ancient Elven smiths. Weapons and armor of this style are sometimes referred to as Elven.*
