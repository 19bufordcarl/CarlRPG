# Torch

When lit on fire, it illuminates out for 30 feet. 
- Lighting a torch requires 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md). 
- The light lasts for 1 hour.

Three torches of materials is enough for an 8 hour campfire instead, suitable for long [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md).
