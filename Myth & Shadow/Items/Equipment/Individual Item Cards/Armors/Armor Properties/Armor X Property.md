# Armor X
Armor X is the main property of all [Armor](../../../Armor.md) sets.

When you would take [Mundane Damage](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) or [Silver Damage](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Silver%20Damage.md), you reduce that damage by X. 

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items, winged boots instead of your normal boots, for example, without affecting the [Armor X Property](Armor%20X%20Property.md) unless the item states otherwise.

### Don / Doff
Normal Armor takes 1 minute (10 combat [Rounds](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to don / doff.
