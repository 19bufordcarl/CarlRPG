# Shield
Shield is the main property of all shields.
- Shields require a one free hand to wield.
- Shields grant the bearer the [Shield Block](Shield%20Property.md#Shield%20Block) ability.

#### Shield Block
Shield Block is a [Reaction](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md). 

You may use this reaction after an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) against you is made. 

You block the [Attack's](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) [Mundane](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) or [Silver Damage](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Silver%20Damage.md).
- You add 1 to your [Armor X Property](Armor%20X%20Property.md) for the calculation of this attack's damage.
	- If you are unarmored, treat X as 0.

*(Reminder that [Reactions](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) can only be used once per [Round](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)).*
