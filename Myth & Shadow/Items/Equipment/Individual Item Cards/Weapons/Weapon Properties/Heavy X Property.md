# Heavy X
#HeavyX means that your [Attacks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) deal half damage unless you have X [Strength](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).
#Deprecated 
~~When you succeed on an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md), roll double the damage dice and use the highest result(s).~~

~~*The heavy weight of these weapons decreases the variability of their damage.*~~
