# Ranged
#Ranged means the weapon can be used to make [Ranged Attacks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) with its specified range. If you want to [Move](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) on the same [Turn](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) as you attack with a [Ranged Weapon](../../../Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons), you ***must*** declare so and you get [Disadvantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on the [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) roll.

*If you already attacked without [Disadvantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md), you cannot move that turn.*
## Ammo
[Ranged Weapons](../../../Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) require [Ammo](Ammo%20Property.md). You can reload a [Ranged Weapon](../../../Weapons.md#Ranged%20Weapons) with ammo as part of the [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) action by default.
