# Slow
Slow means that this weapon's [Ranged Attacks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) are made with [Disadvantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md). You can sacrifice all your [Movement](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) on a [Turn](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) to ignore this [Disadvantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) until your next [Turn](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md).
