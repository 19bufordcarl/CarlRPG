# Standard Gear
Standard gear is a list of all the mundane items PCs are expected to use in normal play.

These items are split up by cost. All items are in portions that take up 1 [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md) unless noted.
	*Animals do not go in your [Adventurer's Pack](Adventurer's%20Pack.md) and thus take up no [Item Slots](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).*
