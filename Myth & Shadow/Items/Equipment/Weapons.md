# Weapons

A weapon is an item that can be used to make an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md). Doing so allows the user to deal roll the weapon's specified damage die (or dice) and then add any relevant [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) to get the resulting damage applied from the [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).

See [Weapon Properties](Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Heavy%20X%20Property.md) for details on what each property means.
## Melee Weapons

All these weapons have the [Melee Property](Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Melee%20Property.md).

## Sheathes
Any weapon you get is assumed to come with the appropriate sheathe, which is what takes up the [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md) in your adventurer's pack even when your weapon is drawn.
## Quivers
Ranged weapons come with an empty quiver. A quiver itself does not take up a slot, it is just storage space. Only the ammo takes up slots. Each quiver can hold 1 slot of ammo. By default, you can recover all spent ammo in a fight during a [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md#Recover).
