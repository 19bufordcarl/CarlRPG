# Trained Animals

PCs can have a number of trained animals equal to the maximum of their [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) and [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md).

Animals do not take up item slots, they travel with you.

Draft Horses do not require training and do not count against your number of animal companions.
