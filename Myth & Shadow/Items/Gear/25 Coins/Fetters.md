# Fetters

Metal shackles that can be used to [Restrain](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md) a willing or [Incapacitated](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) creature to the floor.

- If the fetters are not attached to a structure, the movement restriction on this [Restrained](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md) condition only halves the creature's [Movement](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) speed rather than reducing it to 0.
