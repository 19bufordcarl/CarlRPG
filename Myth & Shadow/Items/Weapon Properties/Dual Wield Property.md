# Dual Wield

A Dual Wield weapon can be wielded in the wielder's off hand.

While dual wielding, the wielder can [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) with either of their weapons. If they hit, they can choose to add the damage dice of weapon in their off hand to the damage dealt from this hit. If they do, they must end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) immediately afterwards.
