# Weather

The following tables can be used to generate the weather.

## Mechanical Weather

Subtract 1 from the roll for a region with bad weather. You may subtract more, or create a region with a near permanent [Weather Hazard](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md) if you so desire.

| 2d6 | Weather Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --: | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2 | Severe       | A [Weather Hazard](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md) applies. [Terrain](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain) becomes impassable until it clears. |
| 3-4 | Bad          | A [Weather Hazard](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Elemental%20Hazards.md) applies. [Terrain](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Terrain) becomes difficult.                  |
| 5-6 | Meh          | Something atmospheric, but nothing mechanical                                                                                                                                                         |
|  7+ | Good         | A nice day                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Flavor Weather

If you need more inspiration for the weather type you can use these tables. Generally you should be able to determine what weather would make sense given the setting and severity.
