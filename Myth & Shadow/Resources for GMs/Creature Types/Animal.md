# Animal

Any creature that is part of the world's natural ecology, even if they are fantastical.

Some can see in [Normal Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Normal%20Darkness) fine, but none can naturally see in [Shadowcursed Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Shadowcursed%20Darkness).

*Ex. In Mithrinia, Griffins are animals. Chimeras are not.*
