# Humanoid

Creatures who share the common line of ancestry dating back to ***The Dawn*** when recorded history began. Most physically resemble real-life humans. While their bodies are mortal, they are thought by most religions to possess an immortal soul.

Some can see in [Normal Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Normal%20Darkness) fine, but none can naturally see in [Shadowcursed Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Shadowcursed%20Darkness).
