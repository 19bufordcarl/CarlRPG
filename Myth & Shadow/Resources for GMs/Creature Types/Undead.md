# Undead

Creatures whose body was once full of [Life](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md), but has since been corrupted by [Death](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) magic to a place of not quite dead but not quite alive. The soul that the creature once had is cursed. Either imprisoned, consumed, or departed for another realm.

All undead can see in darkness as though it were daylight.
