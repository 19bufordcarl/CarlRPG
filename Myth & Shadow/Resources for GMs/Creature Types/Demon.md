# Demon

Powerful ancient entities that draw their power from the [Death](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.

All demons can see in darkness as though it were daylight.

Powerful ones usually have innate [Truesight](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/Truesight.md) with no max range.
