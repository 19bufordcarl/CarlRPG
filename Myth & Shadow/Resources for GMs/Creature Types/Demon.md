# Demon

Powerful supernatural entities that come from [Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md).

All demons can see in all [Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md) as though it were daylight.

Powerful ones usually have innate [Truesight](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/Truesight.md) with no max range.
