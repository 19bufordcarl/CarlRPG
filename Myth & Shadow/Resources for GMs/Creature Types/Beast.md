# Beast

Any creature that is part of the world's natural ecology, even if they are fantastical. This could include both plants and animals.

This also includes plants that are more animated than plants in the real world would be.

Some can see in [Normal Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Normal%20Darkness) fine, but none can naturally see in [Shadowcursed Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md#Shadowcursed%20Darkness).

*Ex. In Mithrinia, Griffins are beasts. Myconids are beasts. Chimeras are not.*
