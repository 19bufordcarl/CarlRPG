# Daemon

Powerful supernatural entities that come from [Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md).

All Daemons can see in all [Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md) as though it were daylight.

Powerful ones usually have innate [Truesight](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/Truesight.md) with no max range.

## Lore

*In Elvish, Daemons are called Daethri. They vary greatly in their forms. The common folk often refer to all these otherworldly entities as simply Demons, signifying their belief that they are malevolent spirits, but arcane studies have revealed that many Daethri vary from good, neutral, to evil. The word 'Daethri' is merely meant to denote them as otherworldly entities, but their rarity has cloaked them in mystery, and the common folk tend to believe they are malevolent spirits at heart, hence the common name of "Demon"*.

*The most powerful Daemons are sometimes called [The Lords of Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Lords%20of%20Oblivion/{The%20Lords%20of%20Oblivion}.md).*
