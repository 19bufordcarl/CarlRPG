# Monstrosity

Monstrosities are strange beings not native to Mithrinia. It is unclear whether they came here from another plane or were outright created by the dark magic of the [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Regardless, they are most assuredly brought to Mithrinia by the [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Their presence is horrifying to most mortals, and they tend to stick to the darkest corners of the world.

All monstrosities can see in [Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md) as though it were daylight.
