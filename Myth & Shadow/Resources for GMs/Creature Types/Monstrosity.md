# Monstrosity

Monstrosities are strange beings not native to Mithrinia. It is unclear whether they came here from another plane or were outright created by the dark magic of the [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).

Most scholars believe that they come from [Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md), but unlike the [Demons](Demon.md), they are much more varied and less affected by certain types of magic. Some theorize that they come from the furthest reaches of [Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md), while the [Demons](Demon.md) come from parts of [Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md) closer to the mortal realm. Others believe it is precisely the opposite. Their strange and mysterious origin is a source of ongoing arcane research in an effort to better safeguard the mortal realm from extraplanar threats.

The [Drow](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Drow) refer to all beings from [Oblivion](../Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md) as *Daethric*.

All monstrosities can see in all [Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md) as though it were daylight.
