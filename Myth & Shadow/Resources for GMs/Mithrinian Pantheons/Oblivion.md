# Oblivion

*Oblivion* is the term for the realms beyond the mortal world. It is from here that the [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) is believe to seep in and infest the world with its horrors.

There are many malevolent entities of supreme power that are from beyond the mortal realm. They are the Lords of Oblivion. They do not care for mortal life and frequently have devoted cultists that seek to enact their vile will on innocent people.

It is thought that the realm of dark oblivion surrounds the world of Mithrinia, the empty space in the sky, and beyond its darkness lies realms untold that we can see in the night sky as shining points of light, beautiful nebulae, and inspiring constellation.

There are 4 documented [Lords of Oblivion](Lords%20of%20Oblivion/{The%20Lords%20of%20Oblivion}.md). There may yet be more in the darknessâ€¦
