# Oroken

## Domains

Oroken's [Spell Domains](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) are [Earth](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md) and [Death](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md).

## Ethos

Curse, Poison, Disease, Death. Oroken's followers includes many of those who are cursed from tampering with magic beyond their understanding, the lycanthropes chief among them.

The [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Orcs.md) hold a special hatred for Oroken, as their creation myth states that a tribe of Oroken followers cursed a tribe of elves into their modern Orcish forms.

Some Orcs have embraced Oroken, however, turning to pillaging, raiding, and poisoning.
