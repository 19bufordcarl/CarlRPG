# Thuulc

Thuulc, demon of the deep. Hoarder of forbidden knowledge. Thuulc is said to grant his followers the abilities needed to glimpse the un-glimpseable.

Many a mage have been tempted by the draw of the forbidden knowledge that Thuulc offers. There is some knowledge that the [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) has banned for reason. Word to the wise; let sleeping dogs lie, lest the great beast of the deep wrap his tentacles around your mind.
