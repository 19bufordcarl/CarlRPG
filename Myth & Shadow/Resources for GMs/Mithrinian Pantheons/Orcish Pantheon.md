# Orcish Pantheon

The Orcish Pantheon is only worshipped by evil cults who see his curses as blessings. Most orcs despise these cults as they hold [Oroken](Mithrinian%20Deities/Oroken.md) responsible for cursing them with shortened lifespans. His ways are violent and uncaring.

The Orcish Pantheon chiefly worships Oroken, however it also worships his demon spawn children that he has sired in his conquests.
