# Pantheons

A Pantheon is a collection of [Deities](../../Magic/Deities.md) that are worshipped, or placated, by a certain culture. A PC can only belong to the faith of one Pantheon and one Patron Deity.

Belonging to a certain Pantheon's faith grants PCs certain statuses and rights in the appropriate society, as well as potentially useful ritual knowledge.

*Pantheon's are always campaign specific, and the GM may use a different list.*

## Pantheon Index

### Imperial Pantheon

The [Imperial Pantheon](Imperial%20Pantheon.md) was originally the Pantheon of [Humans](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Humans.md), but now it is the dominant Pantheon of Mithrinia since the founding of the Mithrinian Empire.

### Sylvan Pantheon

The [Sylvan Pantheon](Sylvan%20Pantheon.md) is the ancient Pantheon of the [Elves](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md). It still holds prominence throughout Glynwyn Weald and its surrounding civilizations. Additionally, the warm-blooded animal folk tend to worship the Deities in the Sylvan Pantheon for reverence of the Natural World.

### Drow Pantheon

The [Drow Pantheon](Drow%20Pantheon.md) chiefly worships only one Deity, [Nyx](The%20Living%20Gods/Nyx.md), goddess of Twilight.

Notably, the Drow have significant rites and pilgrimages that followers undergo that directly reference four demons. They are known as *The Adversaries*. The Drow do not worship them, but they have rites that signify Nyx's protection of the Drow from their enemies.

### Dwarven Pantheon

The [Dwarven Pantheon](Dwarven%20Pantheon.md) worships an ancient familial line of giant humanoids whom they call *The Titans*. Dwarven religious scholars believe that their name originally came from their comparison to these mighty beings. [Dwarves](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Dwarves.md) do not see themselves as smaller than the other modern ancestries. They may be a bit shorter, sure, but their muscles tend to be much larger! The Dwarven Deities often value bravery and battle highly.

### Lizardfolk Pantheon

The [Lizardfolk](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Lizardfolk.md) Pantheon is unique as far as Pantheons go, featuring no Deities in the conventional sense. Most worship the life tree **Tox'lith** — a city sized tree at the heart of the Xar'lith Jungle.

### The Cults of Oblivion

There are many malevolent cults that plague the world of Mithrinia. They worship vile entities from [Oblivion](Oblivion.md). These entities differ from the gods. They are not from the distant realms, but the surrounding darkness that you see in the empty sky. In their realms of void and proximity to the mortal realm, they seek followers and to grow their power by consuming mortal souls.

The most powerful beings are known as [The Lords of Oblivion](Lords%20of%20Oblivion/{The%20Lords%20of%20Oblivion}.md).

## Lore

***Scribe's Note***
*The gods of Mithrinia are fickle and ancient. They are believed to lie beyond [Oblivion](Oblivion.md), but this is beyond our observation and current understanding. There are some scholars who question their "divine" nature. Many theories exist as to whether or not ancient myths are to be trusted. Perhaps the divines used to be capable of miracles, or perhaps they are merely fables.*

*[The Lords of Oblivion](Lords%20of%20Oblivion/{The%20Lords%20of%20Oblivion}.md) have much more direct influence in the modern world. Their legions of cultists and unholy monsters are a constant threat to all mortals. They are very likely the cause of the [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Their followers build hidden, blasphemous, profane temples. They are invariably tempted by the evil powers, no doubt. The Arcane Guild and Imperial Temple are united in resisting the threat of necromancy, and oppose it at all costs.*

*There are some dubious accounts of "miracles" being performed through the grace of a god, but this is not widely accepted by the arcane community. There are certainly healing rituals performed at temples across the Empire for her peoples, but this is learnable magic. The priests swear that their rituals and prayer teaches them how to weave the magic more effectively, and the High Imperial Archpriest can call me a heretic all he likes — so long as I oppose necromancy, we are united where it counts. I believe these "rituals" are nothing more than the arcane at work. The god's ability to impact the mortal realm has simply gone unsubstantiated for far too long, save for [Nyx](The%20Living%20Gods/Nyx.md), the living Goddess of the Drow. I am not convinced she is not of Oblivion herself however.*
