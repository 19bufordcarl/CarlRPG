# Helios

## Domains

Helios' [Spell Domains](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) are [Fire](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) and [Life](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md).

## Ethos

Helios is the God of the Sun and the chief of the [Imperial Pantheon](../Imperial%20Pantheon.md). He is symbolized by honor, valor, and justice. He is the patron of those who fight fearlessly for their values, and his followers founded the great Mithrinian Empire.

Most [Humans](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Humans.md) will have grown up primarily worshipping Helios.
