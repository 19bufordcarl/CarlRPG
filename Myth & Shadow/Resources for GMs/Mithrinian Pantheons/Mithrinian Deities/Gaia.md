# Gaia

## Domains

Gaia's [Spell Domains](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) are [Earth](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md) and [Life](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md).

## Ethos

Goddess of the Earth. Symbolized by loyalty, faith, and stalwart character. Patron of the faithful, and those who defend their allies. The [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) who took up the [Imperial Pantheon](../Imperial%20Pantheon.md) tend to choose Gaia as their patron deity. Her teachings inform which types of stonework are sacred and which are blasphemous. The city of Cragstone is adorned with Her likeness.
