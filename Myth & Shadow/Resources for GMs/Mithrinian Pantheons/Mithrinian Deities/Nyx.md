## Ethos

Queen of shadows. Queen of secrets. Holder of the power between true and false, light and shadow, good and evil. The [Drow](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Ash%20Elf%20(Drow)) claim her as the founder of their culture and the one responsible for their ashen skin and hair, a symbol of their rebirth.

Nyx expects strict devotion from her followers, obedience is valued above everything. Shadows and secrets hold the keys to power, she knows all, and you need to know not.
