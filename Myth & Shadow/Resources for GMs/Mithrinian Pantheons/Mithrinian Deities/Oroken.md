# Oroken

## Domains

Oroken's [Spell Domains](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) are [Earth](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md) and [Death](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md).

## Ethos

Curse, Poison, Disease, Death. Oroken's followers includes many of those who are cursed from tampering with magic beyond their understanding, the lycanthropes chief among them. The [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) hold a special hatred for Oroken, as their myths state that a tribe of Oroken followers cursed a tribe of [Elves](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md) who became the [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)), thus their name.

Some [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) have embraced Oroken, however, turning to pillaging, raiding, and poisoning.
