## Ethos

Goddess of the sky, nature, and the winds. Symbolized by understanding and peace. Patron of those who are free spirited and value harmony. [Sylvan](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Forest%20Elf%20(Sylvan)) culture is most appreciative of the rituals associated with Aurora. *Sky above, wind within.*
