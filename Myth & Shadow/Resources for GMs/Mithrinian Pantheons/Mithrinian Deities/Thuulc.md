# Thuulc

## Domains

Thuulc's [Spell Domains](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) are [Water](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md) and [Death](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md).

## Ethos

Thuulc, demon of the deep. While his chief domain is [Water](../../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md), he is the hoarder of all forbidden and arcane knowledge, and grants his followers abilities to glimpse the un-glimpseable.

Many a mage have been tempted by the draw of the forbidden knowledge that Thuulc offers. There is some knowledge that the [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) has banned for reason. Word to the wise; let sleeping dogs lie, lest the great beast of the deep wrap his tentacles around your mind.
