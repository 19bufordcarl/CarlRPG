# Generic Monster Statblocks

This table provides the core statistics for monsters of different [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). The GM can add relevant [Monster Traits](Monster%20Traits.md) to flesh out the statblock.

*If using [Abstract](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) geometry, round their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) to the nearest multiple of 30 in zones.*

These statistics are balanced assuming the monster has no other mechanics. If you give a monster lots of other abilities, recognize that this will increase the "level" of threat it poses.

A monster's [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) represents them doing anything that requires a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). They can be used for more than just dealing damage, but the damage roll provides a baseline of how effective they are.

## Ability Scores

Monsters usually only need a [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) and a [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).

Whichever one they are better at is equal to their d20 bonus.

Whichever one they are worse at is equal to one of the following.

- -2
- 0
- [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their d20 bonus
- Their full d20 bonus

GM discretion applies. The GM may define their ability scores exactly should the rare need arise.
