# Random Encounters

When [Delving](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md) or [Overland Journeying](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md), the encounter die rolling a 1 means a random encounter.

These encounter rules are designed to help you, the GM, fairly determine an encounter and easily run their games. You can use it, or use it as a reference for building your own.

## Encounter Random Table

You are encouraged to use your own random tables, or make random tables that roughly follow the distribution in the table below. See [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md).

|  d6 | Encounter                          |
| --: | ---------------------------------- |
|   1 | High Danger: Above party level     |
| 2-4 | Moderate Danger: About party level |
|   5 | Low Danger: Below party level      |
|   6 | Mystical Encounter                 |

Not all encounters are assumed to be monsters. Some could be environmental, perhaps the onset of a crumbling cavern. Some may even be helpful, like a wandering merchant. Remember to check [Monster Reactions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Monster%20Reactions.md), or [Social Reactions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Social%20Reactions.md), whichever is more appropriate.

Unintelligent monsters make [Morale Checks](Morale.md#Morale%20Checks) to decide if they flee when things get hairy.

## Overland Distance

Have the *Scout* PC make a [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md), with a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 + (creature's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md)).

|            Check Result | Creature Distance | Effect                                                                     |
| ----------------------: | ----------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Failed by 10 or more |            5 feet | PCs are [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md)       |
|                  Failed |           30 feet | None                                                                       |
|               Succeeded |           60 feet | None                                                                       |
| Succeeded by 10 or more |           60 feet | Creatures are [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md) |

*Optional Rule*
If the *Scout* succeeded by 10 or more they may choose to spot it at up to 120 feet instead.

## Delving Distance

The encountered creature(s) are placed at the edge of the PC's vision.

If the PCs are in [Darkness](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md), they are [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md).

## Encounter Direction

If there is not a clear path for the encountered creature(s) to come from, the GM may use a d12 to determine their [O'clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_position) position.

## Creature Behavior

*Optional*
Determine a creature's current behavior, complications, and a goal.

| d10 | Activity                    | Complication    | Goal                                  |
| --: | --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
|   1 | Hunting something           | Hungry          | FOOD (in dire need of a meal)         |
|   2 | Hiding from something       | Being followed  | Coins (d12 x level x 100)             |
|   3 | Guarding something          | Hates boss      | Magic items (equal to level)          |
|   4 | Socializing (if in a group) | Injured         | Random item (for some reason)         |
|   5 | Digging for something       | Caught in trap  | Territory (get out of my swamp)       |
|   6 | Building or nesting         | Tending to ally | Information (rival faction / region)  |
|   7 | Carrying supplies           | Broken gear     | Blood (they need the PCs blood)       |
|   8 | Eating something            | Understaffed    | Trade (a random selection of goodies) |
|   9 | Fighting off creatures      | Captured        | Mission (they are on a quest)         |
|  10 | Sleeping                    | Sickly / Young  | Directions (they are lost)            |

## Pacing Dials

*Optional*
The GM may grant each player a [Reroll Token](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md) to change the result of any [Delving Hazard Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md#Delving%20Hazard%20Die) or [Journey Hazard Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md#Journey%20Hazard%20Die) to whatever they desire.

GMs, use this option only to improve the pacing and fun of the game.
