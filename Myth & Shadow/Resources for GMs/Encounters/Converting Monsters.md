# Converting Monsters

If you are using an adventure for another system that has monster statblocks, you can more or less use them as is. See these guidelines for points that might require attention for conversion.

Alternatively, you can reference the [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) and use the row for the appropriate [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) of the monster you wish to convert, and add some special abilities.

## From Shadowdark

Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- By default, monsters cannot [Reckless Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md#Reckless%20Attack). Deadly monsters may.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same (or +1 for level 10+)
- [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) = Their attack bonus (or [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) it, or 0, or -2, depending)
- [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) = Their attack bonus (or [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) it, or 0, or -2, depending)
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = 1 [Zone](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) (near) or 60 2 [Zones](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) (double near)
- Special Abilities = Same (see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md) applies, or make a ruling)
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) = Same at low levels, you usually don't need them
	- At higher levels, you might want to adjust them up if they come up.
	- Use the attack bonus instead if a score feels too low.

## From BX

Converting monsters from BX is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- By default, monsters cannot [Reckless Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md#Reckless%20Attack). Deadly monsters may.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same if using ascending AC (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same (or +1 for level 10+)
- [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) = Their attack bonus (or [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) it, or 0, or -2, depending)
- [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) = Their attack bonus (or [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) it, or 0, or -2, depending)
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = 1 [Zone](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) or 2 [Zones](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md), whichever seems more appropriate
- Special Abilities = Same (see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md) applies, or make a ruling)
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) = BX doesn't have them. You usually don't need them.

*Note: Don't use ability scores for damage modifiers, monsters have damage scaling built in.*
