# Morale

Morale determines when **unintelligent** monsters will attempt to flee.

The GM determines intelligent monster's behavior as appropriate to the situation.

## Morale Checks

A morale check consults the [Oracle Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Oracle%20Die.md). If the PCs are several [Levels](../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) higher, they can re-roll it.

When any of the follow occur, the GM makes a morale check for the monster(s).

- A solo monster going below [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) HP.
- A group losing [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their members.

If there is a group, the GM only rolls once for the whole group's morale.
