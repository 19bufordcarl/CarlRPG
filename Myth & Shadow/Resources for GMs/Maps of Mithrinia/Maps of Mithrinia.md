# Maps of Mithrinia

Mithrinia is the name of the default world for Myth & Shadow. The Empire dominates the world through it's naval power and control of shipping lanes. Mountains with deep mines are of the upmost importance given they are the only access to Mythril.

The world maps coastlines are reasonably detailed given the extensive naval navigation, but inland exploration is extremely limited. The dangerous and mythical monsters of the world make it hard to chart most regions. [Human](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Human.md) settlements invariably remain close to water.

[Elves](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md) are more resilient to these threats given their long lifespans, healing, and resistance to diseases, but even they tend to stick to water features when at all possible.

The [Lizardfolk](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Lizardfolk.md) also stick close to water, albeit the Xar'lith Jungle's water features are more scattered throughout the land. Those who were raised in Xar'lith are likely to know it's ways and dangers, but more as knowledge of what to avoid than ability to conquer. Lizardfolk culture values living with the land rather than subduing it. To an outlander, Xar'lith is a deadly place.
