## Truths of Amber Lake

Amber Lake is the basin of the Amber River, which flows down through the mountains to the great city of Amber Falls. The mining town of [Palestone](Palestone.md) is critical to the Mythril trade of Amber Falls. The Mythril is transported across the lake to the port city of [Moonpoint](Moonpoint.md), where it is then put on larger river vessels to traverse it's way down to Amber Falls.

Many waterfalls lie along the river, the first of which links the upper basin to the lower basin. These waterfalls mean that there are many other port towns like Moonpoint with a great deal of dock workers who need to transport cargo from the upper docks of the city, down to the lower docks.

Amber Lake attracts a great deal of people from across the Empire as they are always looking for more dock workers and miners. There are many rumors about poor working conditions here, but the wealth of region is attractive to outsiders. The government of Amber Lake is seated in Moonpoint. It consists of Chancellor appointed by a council of nobles. The current Chancellor, Lord Teivan, makes sure that the Mythril keeps flowing at *any* cost.

The surrounding area is full of ancient ruins, and the [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) has taken hold in these places, as well as a canopied swamp on the north end with all sorts of unsavory tall tales that haunt the local populace of monstrosities that lurk within. Presumably these ruins would hold great riches; the Mythril that these mountains hold would have likely attracted many ancient mages.
