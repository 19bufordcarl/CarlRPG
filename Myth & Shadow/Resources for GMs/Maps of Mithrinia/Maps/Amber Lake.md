# Amber Lake

*Generic Fantasy Starting Location*

![](amber_lake.png)

This lake is the basin for the Amber River, which flows down through the mountain to the great city of Amber Falls. The mining town of Palestone is critical to the Mythril trade of the city of Amber Falls. The Mythril is transported across the lake to the port city of [Moonpoint](Moonpoint.md), where it is then put on larger river vessels to traverse it's way down to Amber Falls.

The are many waterfalls along this route, the first of which links the upper basin to the lower basin. These waterfalls mean that there are many other port towns like Moonpoint with a great deal of dock workers who need to transport cargo from the upper docks of the city, down to the lower docks.

The area surrounding Moonpoint is quite fertile with the mountain soil and freshwater, and there are many farming villages surrounding it and through the Amber woods who supply Moonpoint and [Palestone](Palestone.md) with food.

Overall, the Amber Lake region attracts a great deal of people from across the Empire as they are always looking for more dock workers and miners. The working conditions rumors are something the local government frequently quells, there is a great deal of complaining, but new labor is a critical piece to the region's economy. The government is a powerful aristocracy with a single Chancellor appointed by a council of nobles. Chancellor Teivan makes sure that their reputation in the wider Empire doesn't get too soured, at *any* cost.

The surrounding area is full of ancient ruins, and the [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) has taken hold in these places, as well as a canopied swamp on the north end with all sorts of unsavory tall tales that haunt the local populace of monstrosities that lurk within. Presumably, these ruins would hold great riches, given the Mythril that these mountains hold, ancient mages must have been quite interested. Many a travelers have entered, none returnedâ€¦
