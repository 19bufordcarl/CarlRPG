# The World of Mithrinia

## Mithrinia Isn't a Place, It's an Idea

Mithrinia is the name of the default setting for Myth & Shadow. But Mithrinia is not a series of maps. Mithrinia is an idea. I provide default maps to support GMs and inspire ideas.

The core pieces of Mithrinia that are important for the gameplay of Myth & Shadow are:

1. Magic is fickle. It is roll to cast and consumes a valuable resource.
2. The dark is dangerous. The [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) makes it so PCs are always on edge.
3. Ancestries are lightweight and relatable. There are no immortal races of god children walking around the city. These take away from the danger and tension of the setting.

This means that you should be able to use Myth & Shadow with a wide variety of published settings. All you need to do is make sure those 3 things make sense in your setting.

### [Mithrinia World Map](Maps/Mithrinia%20World%20Map.md)

The Empire dominates the world through it's naval power and control of shipping lanes. Mountains with deep mines are of the upmost importance given they are the only access to Mythril.

The world maps coastlines are reasonably detailed given the extensive naval navigation, but inland exploration is extremely limited. The dangerous and mythical monsters of the world make it hard to chart most regions. [Human](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Human.md) settlements invariably remain close to water.

[Elves](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elf.md) are more resilient to these threats given their long lifespans, healing, and resistance to diseases, but even they tend to stick to water features when at all possible.

The animal folk are scattered throughout the world in their favored habitats, and are quite rare, and generally not too involved in the geopolitical machinations of the Empire.

These maps are not the end all be all. Feel free to use or make your own maps. These do serve as the default, and also as a source of inspiration for the kind of world Mithrinia imagines.
