# Strongholds

A stronghold represents a player owned faction in the world. Strongholds will usually start under the jurisdiction of an existing government or faction in the world, but they can also start on their own. Stronghold play allows sufficiently powerful characters (typically at least 7th [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)) to start having great impact on the world. By this point, the PCs are powerful enough to meaningfully challenge the power of existing governments and stronghold play is the rules for how players can make their own society.

Generally, [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) governs any rolls relating to leading strongholds by PCs.

## Types of Society's

The numbers given in the [Strongholds](../Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Strongholds/Strongholds.md) prices and the types of descriptions are generally modeled on a hybrid of economics from the Roman Empire and Medieval Europe. Obviously, there are society's that differ greatly from these, and it is perfectly valid for players to want to build a different type of society. For the purpose of game balance, however, it is best to use these prices at least as a rough guideline for how much money, and thus [Mythril](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Mythril.md) — power — a stronghold of a certain size costs to maintain and can generate for it's people.

The players can reskin any of these items to be whatever makes sense to them for the kind of society they want to build, so long as the core math of amount of Mythril in and amount of Mythril out of the stronghold every month is not dramatically changed.
