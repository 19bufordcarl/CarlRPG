# Availability

This largely depends on the exact campaign circumstances, and accordingly is left to the GM. Using the tables [here](https://gist.github.com/beaurancourt/a2dbaaf130683168bbda12c7bc53a895) is a good reference is balanced to the math of Myth & Shadow.

The one exception to that reference would be [demographics of leveled characters](https://gist.github.com/beaurancourt/a2dbaaf130683168bbda12c7bc53a895#demographics-of-leveled-characters). Generally, it is assumed that the world is a bit lower magic. While this chart is fine for non-casters, for casters the chart should look more like the one below.

## Caster Demographics

| Level | Frequency        |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 1     | 1 in 50          |
| 2     | 1 in 150         |
| 3     | 1 in 500         |
| 4     | 1 in 1,000       |
| 5     | 1 in 10,000      |
| 6     | 1 in 20,000      |
| 7     | 1 in 100,000     |
| 8     | 1 in 500,000     |
| 9     | 1 in 2,000,000   |
| 10    | 1 in 10,000,000  |
| 10+   | Exceedingly Rare |

So a village with 500 people likely has 1 3rd level caster, two 2nd level, and ten 1st level.
