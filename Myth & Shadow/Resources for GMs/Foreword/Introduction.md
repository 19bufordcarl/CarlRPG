# Introduction

I want to create a TTRPG that emphasizes (in order)

1. Verisimilitude
2. Player choice
3. Progression
4. Strategy over Tactics

I believe that with these ingredients you get the most ability for engaging stories at the table beyond whatever the GM has planned. Verisimilitude is paramount because if I as player don't believe in the consistency of the world than I cannot make plans to act in it, my choices feel arbitrary. As a result, the progression won't make sense or won't feel earned, I won't really care about the tactics, and the story will fall apart.

Everything stems from the players buying in, and so getting the players to buy in is my paramount task. I endeavor to run games that I want to play in, so the verisimilitude I opt for is one that makes me feel good about it when I run the game, with the belief that this attitude will rub off on my players. Belief is contagious.

When I say strategy over tactics, I mean that there is more decision making focus on things like:

- Deciding what spells to learn
- Deciding where to adventure next
- Deciding who to attack and who to influence
- Deciding when to engage in combat
- Deciding where to engage in combat

When I say tactics, I refer to specific choices in a combat, like not moving because it will provoke an opportunity attack, deciding to use a bonus action for an offhand attack or casting a spell. These choices have been paired down compared to 5e systems to make the combat flow much faster, and encourage more focus on the world and less on the character sheet.
