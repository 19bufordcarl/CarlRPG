# Introduction

I want to create a TTRPG that emphasizes

1. Narrative verisimilitude
2. Player choice
3. PC progression

I believe that with these ingredients you get the most ability for engaging stories at the table. Verisimilitude is paramount because if a player does not believe in the "reality" of world then choices feel arbitrary and the narrative will suffer. As a result, the progression won't make sense or won't feel earned. The game falls apart.

For new players, go to [New Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md).
