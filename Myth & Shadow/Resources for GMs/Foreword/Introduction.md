# Introduction

This TTRPG emphasizes

1. Narrative verisimilitude
2. Player choice
3. PC progression

## Who is This Game For?

This game is great for teaching new people d20-based fantasy RPGs. There is enough mechanical depth to allow for rich character customization and growth, but it is spread out more evenly throughout 10 levels of play rather than being frontloaded at character creation.

New players are not expected to read through an extensive list of classes and subclasses, the game is classless and relies instead on players increasing the six classic [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md).

New players are also not expected to have to randomly generate a character and roll with it if they have a particular character fantasy that enticed them to try TTRPGs in the first place.

Myth & Shadow rules are lightweight but not rules light. There is lots of room for GM interpretation, but a rule will usually say when the GM needs to provide their input. More often than not, there is a defined set of rules that apply for a given situation.

## How to Play

The core gameplay loop of Myth & Shadow is:

1. The GM describes the environment
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The GM narrates the results of the actions, and calls for relevant rolls.

Myth & Shadow generally expects that the GM has prior TTRPG experience, but it is absolutely possible for a new GM to run this system. The core procedures of [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md) and [Dungeon Crawl](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Dungeon%20Crawl.md) will be the most useful for a GM to learn to run the game.
