# Why Item Slots

The goal of the system is to preserve verisimilitude of how much stuff PCs can reasonably have on them, as well as provide opportunities for decisions with clear costs. Example: Do I carry an additional torch into the dungeon or a shield?

These decisions are only interesting when the PCs are in danger. That is why the party starts with access to a horse and wagon. You can abstract this to be something else, like a storehouse, but the core idea is that when the PCs are not in danger, they should be able to "stash" any number of items so long as they aren't obviously too big to stash. There is usually some way you could describe carrying this stuff that wouldn't be too outlandish given there is no time threat or danger. But, when there is a time threat or danger, you only have access to what you can fit in your pack.
