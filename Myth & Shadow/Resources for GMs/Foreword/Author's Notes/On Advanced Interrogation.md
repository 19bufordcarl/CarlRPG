# On "Advanced Interrogation"

Torture does not work. This is well [documented](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/review-why-torture-doesnt-work-neuroscience-interrogation), [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/), and [here](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830471-200-torture-doesnt-work-says-science-why-are-we-still-doing-it/) and don't forget [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198758/). Now that the verisimilitude aspect is addressed, the gameplay portion. Roleplaying a torture scene is a very dark and likely triggering experience for a lot of people. A lot of pop culture tends to glorify these sorts of encounters, but I find it really uncomfortable to act out these scenes. I prefer the approach of letting players know up front that this is not how this game works.

When the players capture enemies, I simply tell the players what information their captives are willing to divulge. After that point the players can decide whether to let them free or not. While a conversation building rapport with their captives might reveal more details, I make it very clear to them that no amount of torture will aid them in their information gathering from the get go.

*An aside, this is one of my biggest problems with 5e, the **intimidation** skill. I find it leads players to conclude that they should engage in torture / torture adjacent behavior to get information.*
