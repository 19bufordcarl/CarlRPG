# Why Prices Needed to Change

BX item prices often do not make internally consistent sense, which causes issues for determining how many [NPC Hirelings](../../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Stronghold%20Rules/NPC%20Hirelings.md) the party can afford and, more generally, how much economic influence the PCs have over the world.

For example, rations in BX cost 5gp for 7 days, and unskilled followers cost 2gp for a month. Rations should not be more expensive than normal food, hard tack and jam is not particularly expensive, and 2gp for a month would put the cost of a days labor at 7cp a day, assuming no bonus for the risk they take on. Laborers cannot even afford to feed themselves here.

Players are expected to get strongholds and thus raise armies, but if feeding an army for a day costs roughly as much as their payment for a month, then it's hard to reason about how wealthy you are. Can you feed yourself for life? No. Can you hire a personal assistant for life? Yes. More than just a realism issue, this is also problematic for game balance, as one of those is clearly more useful than the other, yet cheaper.

Thus why cost of labor is what is used as the basis for conversion and thus why 1 coin in Myth & Shadow is equal to a silver piece , the assumed cost of a day of risk-less commoner labor.

## GM Module Reward Conversions

Dungeon rewards are assumed to exist apart from the in world economy, these are usually deadly ancient ruins shrouded in mythology where you risk life and limb to become lavishly wealthy. Most adventurers don't make it back alive. These rewards *should* be large.

Quests given by members of civilization, or loot in civilization, should make sense, and you should reduce its value to be in line with the paradigm *1 coin is a day of labor*. These rewards should be lower. If you think a module put too much wealth in civilization, a good rule of thumb is to step everything down a denomination. (i.e. the copper is now 1/10th its listed amount, the silver is now copper, the gold is now silver).
	Go [Delving](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md) for wealth, not help the barkeep clear the rats in the basement.

For magical items in modules, you can use the price listed, it's ok if they are inflated. Typically there will not be a price listed as there is very little magical trade, it is at least heavily restricted by the Imperial Arcane Guild.
