# A Note About Notes

These notes are pretty raw. They reflect my immediate thinking as I was detailing out parts of the system, and more exist for my own sorting out than intended to be helpful to readers. That being said, I think that this kind of reasoning can be helpful to see the authorial intent, whether or not the system is right for you, and if you have feedback, may make it more constructive by providing you with better insight into my thought process.
