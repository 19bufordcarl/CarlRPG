# Shipwright

Sea worthy vessels can withstand normal bad weather conditions (storms and such) at sea, while unseaworthy vessels will be capsized if bad weather happens while out at sea. Small ships are not seaworthy and cannot carry a wagon or other stash. Large ships are seaworthy and can carry a wagon or other stash.
