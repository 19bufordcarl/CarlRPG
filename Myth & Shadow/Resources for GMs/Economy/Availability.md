# Availability

This largely depends on the exact campaign circumstances, and accordingly is left to the GM. Using the tables [here](https://gist.github.com/beaurancourt/a2dbaaf130683168bbda12c7bc53a895) is a good reference and balanced to the math of Myth & Shadow.

The one exception to that reference would be [demographics of leveled characters](https://gist.github.com/beaurancourt/a2dbaaf130683168bbda12c7bc53a895#demographics-of-leveled-characters). Generally, higher levels become much more impactful in Myth & Shadow.

## Leveled Humanoid NPC Demographics

| Level | Martial Frequency | Caster Frequency |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | 1 in 20           | 1 in 50          |
| 2     | 1 in 50           | 1 in 150         |
| 3     | 1 in 150          | 1 in 500         |
| 4     | 1 in 400          | 1 in 1,000       |
| 5     | 1 in 1,000        | 1 in 10,000      |
| 6     | 1 in 3,000        | 1 in 20,000      |
| 7     | 1 in 10,000       | 1 in 100,000     |
| 8     | 1 in 30,000       | 1 in 500,000     |
| 9     | 1 in 100,000      | 1 in 2,000,000   |
| 10    | 1 in 300,000      | 1 in 10,000,000  |
| 10+   | 1 in 1,000,000    | Exceedingly Rare |

So a village with 500 people likely has:

- One 4th level martial
- One 3rd level caster and three 3rd level martials
- Two 2nd level casters and ten 2nd level martials
- Ten 1st level casters and twenty 1st level martials
