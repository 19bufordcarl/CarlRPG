# Converting Monsters

If you are using an adventure for another system that has monster statblocks, you can more or less use them as is. See this guidelines for points that might require attention for conversion. Alternatively, you can reference the [Quick Monster Statblocks](Quick%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) and use the row for the appropriate [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) of the monster you wish to convert.

## From Shadowdark

Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- When they miss a melee attack, they can end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash), dealing damage equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1.
		- Nat 1s always miss, you cannot use a melee bash then.
	- Don't use ability scores for damage modifiers, they have multi-attack damage scaling.
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Ability%20Scores.md) = Same (usually)
	- If their primary ability(s) is less than their attack bonus, use their attack bonus.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = "Near" in Shadowdark is 30 feet
	- *If using variable [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) for tactical grided play.*
	- If the creature is
		1. not wearing heavy armor or otherwise slowed,
		2. has positive [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md),
	- Then add (5' x their [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md)) to their default move speed.
- Special Abilities = Same (see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/!Conditions.md) applies, or make a ruling)

## From BX

Converting monsters from BX is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- When they miss a melee attack, they can end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash), dealing damage equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1.
		- Nat 1s always miss, you cannot use a melee bash then.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same if using ascending AC (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = 30 feet
	- *If using variable [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) for tactical grided play.*
	- If the creature is
		1. not wearing heavy armor or otherwise slowed,
		2. seems relatively agile,
	- Then add (5' x [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)) to this move speed.
- Special Abilities = Same (see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/!Conditions.md) applies, or make a ruling)
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Ability%20Scores.md) = BX doesn't have them. Use the following procedure:
	- Grab the d20 bonus from [Quick Monster Statblocks](Quick%20Monster%20Statblocks.md):
	- Their primary ability is this d20 bonus.
	- Their secondary ability is half this bonus.
	- Their other abilities are either 0 or a quarter of this bonus.
	- Their worst ability is either 0 or however negative you think it should be.
