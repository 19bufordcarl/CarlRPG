# Converting Monsters

If you are using an adventure for another system that has monster statblocks, you can more or less use them as is. See this guidelines for points that might require attention for conversion. Alternatively, you can reference the [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) and use the row for the appropriate [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) of the monster you wish to convert. Then add any special abilities.

## From Shadowdark

Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- When they miss a melee attack, they can end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash), dealing damage equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1.
		- Nat 1s always miss, you cannot use a melee bash then.
	- Don't use ability scores for damage modifiers, they have multi-attack damage scaling.
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) = Same (usually)
	- If their primary ability(s) is less than their attack bonus, use their attack bonus.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = 30 feet (near) or 60 feet (double near)
- Special Abilities = Same (see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md) applies, or make a ruling)

## From BX

Converting monsters from BX is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- When they miss a melee attack, they can end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash), dealing damage equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1.
		- Nat 1s always miss, you cannot use a melee bash then.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same if using ascending AC (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = 30 feet or 60 feet, whichever seems closer
- Special Abilities = Same (see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md) applies, or make a ruling)
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) = BX doesn't have them. Use the following procedure:
	- Grab the d20 bonus from [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md):
	- Their primary ability is this d20 bonus.
	- Their secondary ability is half this bonus.
	- Their other abilities are either 0 or a quarter of this bonus.
	- Their worst ability is either 0 or however negative you think it should be.
