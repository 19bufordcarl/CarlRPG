# Converting Monsters

## From Shadowdark

Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.

- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) and Damage = Same
	- When they miss a melee attack, they can end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) to [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md#Melee%20Bash), dealing damage equal to [Half](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1.
		- Nat 1s always miss, you cannot use a melee bash then.
	- Don't use ability scores for damage modifiers, they have multi-attack damage scaling.
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) = Same (usually)
	- If their primary ability(ies) is less than their attack bonus, use their attack bonus.
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same (or +1 for level 10+)
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same (or round up to the nearest 5 HP)
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) = "Near" in Shadowdark is 30 feet
	- *If using variable [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) for tactical grided play.*
	- If the creature is
		1. not wearing heavy armor or otherwise slowed,
		2. has positive [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md),
	- Then add (5' x [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md)) to their default move speed.
- Special Abilities = Same, see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Conditions/!Conditions.md) applies, or make a ruling.
