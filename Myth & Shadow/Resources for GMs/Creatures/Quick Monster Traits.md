# Quick Monster Traits

When using [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) to create monsters on the fly, you can add some traits to the monster that would make sense based on its environment. Use this method when building your own monsters, or if the adventure you are running does not provide a usable statblock.

## Actions (Attack)

These traits require a monster to use one of its attack actions.

| Action | Effect                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Magic  | Cast a [Spell](../../Magic/Spellcasting/Spells.md) |
| Ranged | Make a ranged attack (Subtract 1 from the damage)  |

## Passive

These traits passively apply to a monster.

| Passive         | Example               | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
