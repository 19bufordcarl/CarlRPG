# Monster Traits

When using [Quick Monster Statblocks](Quick%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) to create monsters on the fly, you can add some traits to the monster that would make sense based on its environment. Use this method when building your own monsters, or if the adventure you are running does not provide a usable statblock.

## Actions

These traits require a monster to use one (or more) of its attack actions.

| Action          | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

They must make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check or be turned to stone and [Paralyzed](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Damage Burst    | The monster can forgo all of its attacks to create a 20 foot [Aura](../../Magic/Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) at a point it can see. Affected creatures make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX ([Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), or [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)) check (depending on the nature of the burst). On a failure, they take damage equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the monster's total dice (DPR). On a success, they half as much. |

## Passives

These traits passively apply to a monster.

| Attach               | Stirge                | On hit: Becomes attached. Automatically hits attacks while attached.

| Blindsight           | Giant Scorpion        | The creature has some method of fine perception that does not rely on sight, and is thus unaffected by [Blinded](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Cursed Disease       | Werewolf / Vampire    | If you take [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) damage from this monster, you contract their magical disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
