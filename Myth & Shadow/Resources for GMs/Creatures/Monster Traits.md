# Monster Traits

When using [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) to create monsters, you can add some traits to the monster that would make sense based on its environment. Use this method when building your own monsters, or if the adventure you are running does not provide a usable statblock.

## Actions

These traits require a monster to use one (or more) of its attack actions.

| Action          | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Petrifying Gaze | Target a creature the monster can see.

On a failure, they are turned to stone and [Paralyzed](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Damage Burst    | The monster can forgo all of its attacks to create a 20 foot [Aura](../../Magic/Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) at a point it can see. Affected creatures make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) or [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) depending on the nature of the burst. On a failure, they take damage equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the monster's DPR. On a success, they take half as much. |

## Passives

These traits passively apply to a monster.

| Passive              | Example               | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Blindsight           | Giant Scorpion        | The creature has some method of fine perception that does not rely on sight, and is thus unaffected by [Blinded](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Cursed Disease       | Werewolf / Vampire    | If you take [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) damage from this monster, you contract their magical disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Damage Aura          | Demon Lord            | Creatures who start or end their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) within melee of the monster take damage equal to half the damage of one of the monster's attacks. (Reduce the # of attacks by 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Damage Transfer      | Archlich              | When the monster takes damage, they transfer half or all of that damage (their choice) to a *willing* creature nearby (60').                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
