# Creature Statblocks Explained

## Base Stats

This contains the most relevant information, the [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), and [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md).

| [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) | [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) | [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) | [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                                                    12 |                                                                       5 |                                             30' |                                                                1 |

Monster HP can be randomly generated by rolling [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) d8s and adding the level to the result.

- Alternatively, subtract 5 from their HP, and then add d8 + 1 to it to get tighter variance.
(If the have a worn armor it is listed here. This can be looted. Otherwise it is natural armor.)

## Ability Scores

These are the ability scores for the creature, which are used for any [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). Creatures do not have a [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) usually, it will be specified if they do.

| Abilities | [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) | [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) | [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) | [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) | [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md)<br> | [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)<br> |
| --------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    Scores |                                                                     1 |                                                                      -1 |                                                                             0 |                                                                            -1 |                                                                     2 |                                                                         0 |

## Attacks

The attacks the creature can make are listed here. If an attack applies a special ability, the special ability is only applied if the attack beat the target's [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). When a [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) does not beat the [Armor Class](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), you still apply the damage modifier (that would mean 1 damage here), you just don't roll any damage dice. Same with a [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md), except if the result was less than 10, the attack misses. These are the standard rules for [Melee Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) and [Ranged Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md).

The bonuses for attacks will **NOT** always line up with [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md). Use these modifiers!

- [Medium Simple Weapon](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Melee%20Weapons/Medium%20Simple%20Weapon.md)
	- +1 to [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) rolls
	- d6 + 1 damage
- [Light Crossbow](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Ranged%20Weapons/Light%20Crossbow.md)
	- +0 to [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) rolls
	- d4 damage

## Special Abilities

Special abilities will specify exactly how they work.

[Heal Wounds](../../Magic/Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Heal%20Wounds.md) (1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md), [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md), 1d6 + 1 [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md))
