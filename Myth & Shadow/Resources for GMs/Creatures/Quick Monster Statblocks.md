# Quick Monster Statblocks

This table provides the core statistics for monsters of different [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). The GM can add relevant [Monster Traits](Monster%20Traits.md) to flesh out the statblock.
*If using [Abstract](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) geometry, round their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) to the nearest multiple of 30.*

These statistics are balanced assuming the monster has no other mechanics. If you give a monster lots of other abilities, recognize that this will increase the effective level of threat it poses.

## Ability Scores

The monster's primary ability score(s) is equal to their attack bonus. Their medium ability scores are equal to the number of attacks they have (or 0 if attack bonus is 0). Their weak ability score(s) is equal to the number of attacks they have minus 4.
