# Diseases

Certain diseases are more magical in nature and thus have much more expansive mechanics than the basic disease detailed in [Monster Traits](Monster%20Traits.md) that give temporary [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Constitution.md) damage.

They are detailed here.

## Lycanthropy

If a PC takes [Health Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) damage from a Werewolf, that PC contracts the magical disease of Lycanthropy. They will begin to dream of the moon and hunting prey. While they are diseased, the disease is curable. On the next full moon, they will forcibly transform. Once they have transformed, the curse will take hold and there is no known cure.

While cursed, you are [Immune](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) and diseases and can eat raw meat.

### Transformation

You transform under the full moon. While transformed, increase your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Constitution.md) by your [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). This may raise them above 10.

While transformed, you are compelled to hunt the innocent. If you do not eat the heart of a stranger who has done no evil that you are aware of by the time the sun rises, you will become [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md). Your sleep becomes restless. Accordingly, sleeping will not rid you of this exhaustion. You will transform every night until you consume an innocent heart.
