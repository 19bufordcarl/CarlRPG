# Generic Monster Statblocks

This table provides the core statistics for monsters of different [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). The GM can add relevant [Monster Traits](Monster%20Traits.md) to flesh out the statblock.
*If using [Abstract](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Abstract) geometry, round their [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) to the nearest multiple of 30 in zones.*

These statistics are balanced assuming the monster has no other mechanics. If you give a monster lots of other abilities, recognize that this will increase the "level" of threat it poses.

## Ability Scores

Monsters usually only need a [Physical Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) and a [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).

Whichever one they are better at is equal to their d20 bonus — GM discretion.

Whichever one they are worse at is equal to 0 if they are [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 0-3, or [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their d20 bonus if they are [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 4 or greater.

Legendary monsters have both equal to their d20 bonus — like dragons perhaps.
