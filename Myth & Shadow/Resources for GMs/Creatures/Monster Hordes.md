# Monster Hordes

Running more than roughly ten monsters at a time can get unwieldy. Same is the case with too many [Companions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Companions.md). To counteract this you can treat lots of smaller monsters as a horde.

## Making a Horde

Sum together the levels of the creatures in the horde and use the [Generic Monster Statblock](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md) for that level, adding any relevant abilities to the horde, but it only makes [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the normal number of attacks. [{AOE} Area of Effect](../../Magic/Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/{AOE}%20Area%20of%20Effect.md) abilities deal double damage against a horde. When the horde is reduce to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) of its [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md), you also [Halve](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) the number of attacks the horde gets again.
