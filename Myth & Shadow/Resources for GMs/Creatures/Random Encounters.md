# Random Encounters

When [Delving](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md) or [Overland Journeying](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md), the encounter die rolling a 1 means a random encounter.

These encounter rules are designed to help you, the GM, fairly determine an encounter and easily run their games. You can use it, or use it as a reference point for building your own.

## Encounter Random Table

You are encouraged to use your own random tables, or make random tables that roughly follow the distribution in the table below. See [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md).

|   d12 | Encounter                             |
| ----: | ------------------------------------- |
|     1 | Extreme Danger: Far above party level |
|   2-3 | High Danger: Above party level        |
|   4-9 | Moderate Danger: About party level    |
| 10-11 | Low Danger: Below party level         |
|    12 | Mystical Encounter                    |

Not all encounters should be monsters. Some could be environmental, perhaps the onset of a blizzard. One rare encounter could even be helpful, perhaps a traveling merchant, or a mythical spirit animal. Remember to check [Monster Reactions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Monster%20Reactions.md), or [Social Reactions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Social%20Reactions.md), whichever is more appropriate. This helps keep the variety of the game high.

## Overland Distance and Direction

Have the *Scout* PC make a [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check, with a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 + (2 x [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) of creature).

- On a success, they spot the creature at a distance of about 60 feet *(2d6x10 feet)*.
	- If they succeeded by 5 or more, the creature is unaware of them â€” *see [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md)*.
		- Staying undetected for an extended time requires stealth ([Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md)) checks from each PC within sight range of the creature.
- On a failure, they do not spot the creature until it is 30 feet away.
	- If it is hostile, roll [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Initiative.md).
	- PCs are [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md) if they were asleep or if the creature is stealthy.

## Delving Distance and Direction

The encounter monster(s) are placed at a random direction at the edge of the PCs vision. By default, a d12 determines their "[O'clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_position)" position.

## Creature Behavior

Creature's should have ongoing behavior, complications, and a goal. This makes them dynamic when engaged if the reaction roll was such that they are not immediately hostile and gives you an idea of how to use them to progress the adventure.

| d12 | Activity                    | Complication    | Goal                                         |
| --: | --------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Hunting something           | Hungry          | FOOD (in dire need of a meal)                |
| 3-4 | Hiding from something       | Being followed  | Coins (d12 x level x 100)                    |
|   5 | Guarding something          | Hates boss      | Magic items (equal to level)                 |
|   6 | Socializing (if in a group) | Injured         | Random item (for some reason)                |
|   7 | Digging for something       | Caught in trap  | Territory (get out of my swamp)              |
|   8 | Building or nesting         | Tending to ally | Information (rival faction / region)         |
|   9 | Carrying supplies           | Broken gear     | Blood (they need the PCs blood)              |
|  10 | Eating something            | Understaffed    | Trade (a random selection of goodies)        |
|  11 | Fighting off creatures      | Captured        | Mission (they are in service to another NPC) |
|  12 | Sleeping                    | Sickly / Young  | Directions (they are lost)                   |
