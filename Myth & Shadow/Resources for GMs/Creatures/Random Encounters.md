# Random Encounters

When [Delving](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Delving.md) or [Overland Journeying](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Overland%20Journeys.md), the encounter die rolling a 1 means a random encounter.

These encounter rules are designed to help you, the GM, fairly determine an encounter and easily run their games. You can use it, or use it as a reference point for building your own.

## Encounter Random Table

You are encouraged to use your own random tables, or make random tables that roughly follow the distribution in the table below. See [Generic Monster Statblocks](Generic%20Monster%20Statblocks.md).

|   d12 | Encounter                             |
| ----: | ------------------------------------- |
|     1 | Extreme Danger: Far above party level |
|   2-3 | High Danger: Above party level        |
|   4-9 | Moderate Danger: About party level    |
| 10-11 | Low Danger: Below party level         |
|    12 | Mystical Encounter                    |

Not all encounters should be monsters. Some could be environmental, perhaps the onset of a blizzard. One rare encounter could even be helpful, perhaps a traveling merchant, or a mythical spirit animal. Remember to check [Monster Reactions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Monster%20Reactions.md), or [Social Reactions](../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Social%20Reactions.md), whichever is more appropriate. This helps keep the variety of the game high.

## Overland Distance and Direction

Have the *Scout* PC make a [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check, with a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 + (2 x [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) of creature).

- On a success, they spot the creature at a distance of about 60 feet *(2d6x10 feet)*.
	- If they succeeded by 5 or more, the creature is unaware of them â€” *see [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md)*.
		- Staying undetected for an extended time requires stealth ([Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md)) checks from each PC within sight range of the creature.
- On a failure, they do not spot the creature until it is 30 feet away.
	- If it is hostile, roll [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Initiative.md).
	- PCs are [Surprised](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Surprised.md) if they were asleep or if the creature is stealthy.

## Delving Distance and Direction

The encounter monster(s) are placed at a random direction at the edge of the PCs vision. By default, a d12 determines their "[O'clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_position)" position.

## Creature Behavior

Determine a creature's current behavior, complications, and a goal for more dynamic play.
