# Monstrosity (Shadowcursed)

Strange beings not native to this world. They either came or were created by the dark magic of the [Shadowcurse](../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Their presence is horrifying to most mortals, and they tend to stick to the darkest corners of the world.
