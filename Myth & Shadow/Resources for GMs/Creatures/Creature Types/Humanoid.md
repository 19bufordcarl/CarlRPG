# Humanoid

Creatures who share the common line of ancestry dating back when the Deities gave immortal souls a physical form on the material plane in the days of creation. They tend to physical resemble humans. While all possess an immortal soul, the days of pure creation are long past, and many of their bodies are now frail an brittle. They are mortal, and have short lifespans on the material plane.
