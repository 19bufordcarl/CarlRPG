# Magic Diseases

Certain diseases are more magical in nature and thus have much more expansive mechanics than the basic disease detailed in [Monster Traits](Monster%20Traits.md).

## Lycanthropy

If a PC takes [Health Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) damage from a Werewolf, that PC contracts the magical disease of Lycanthropy. They will begin to dream of the moon and hunting prey. While they are diseased, the disease is curable. On the next full moon, they will forcibly transform. Once they have transformed, the curse will take hold and there is no known cure.

### Passives

While cursed, you are [Immune](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) and diseases.

### Transformation

You transform under the full moon. While transformed, increase your [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) by your [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). This may raise them above 10.

While transformed, you are compelled to hunt the innocent. If you do not eat the heart of a stranger who has done no evil that you are aware of by the time the sun rises, you will become [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md). Your sleep becomes restless. Accordingly, sleeping will not rid you of this exhaustion. You will transform every night until you consume an innocent heart.

## Vampirism

If a PC takes [Health Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) damage from a Vampire, that PC contracts the magical disease of Vampirism. They will begin to dream of blood. While they are diseased, the disease is curable. After 3 days, they will die, That night, they will rise as an [Undead](Creature%20Types/Undead.md) vampire. The curse has taken hold and there is no known cure at this point.

### Passives

As an [Undead](Creature%20Types/Undead.md) vampire, you:

- Are [Immune](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to [Mundane Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) and diseases.
- Are [Resistant](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Resistant.md) to [Cold](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage.
- Are [Vulnerable](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Vulnerable.md) to [Fire](../../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) and [Pure](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage.
- Take 1d6 [Pure](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) spent in sunlight.
- Restore all [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) on a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
- Have [Bloodlust](Magic%20Diseases.md#Bloodlust).
- Start as a [Spawn](Magic%20Diseases.md#Spawn).

### Bloodlust

You are compelled to drink blood. If you do not drain a [Humanoid](Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) of their blood every day, you will become [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md). Your sleep becomes restless. Accordingly, sleeping will not rid you of this exhaustion.

### Spawn

As an [Undead](Creature%20Types/Undead.md) vampire, you start as a spawn, enthralled to the vampiric master who turned you. They may release you from their control willingly. Otherwise, the enthrallment lasts as long as they live. Once you are released, you become a [True Vampire](Magic%20Diseases.md#True%20Vampire).

### True Vampire

Once you are released from your spawn status, you become a true vampire. If would die, you instead turn to mist and begin reconstituting in your *Coffin*. Your body reconstitutes and you are restored to full [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) at the next dusk.

You can only be killed by Sunlight, [Pure](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage, or with a wooden stake driven through your heart while you are reconstituting inside your *Coffin*.
