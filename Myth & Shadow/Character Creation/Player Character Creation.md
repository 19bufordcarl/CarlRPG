# Player Character Creation

A Player Character is referred to as a PC. All other characters are Non-Player Characters (NPCs). Hostile NPCs are often referred to as monsters.

		- [ ] Equals [Level](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) + (5 x [Health](../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md))
	- [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) (LV)
		- [ ] Start at level 1
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Experience%20Points.md) (XP)
		- [ ] Start with 0 XP
