# Default Ability Generation

For each of the 6 [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md), roll 3d6.

| 3d6 Roll Total | Starting Ability Score |
| -------------- | ---------------------: |
| 3              |                     -4 |
| 4-5            |                     -3 |
| 6-7            |                     -2 |
| 8-9            |                     -1 |
| 10-11          |                      0 |
| 12-13          |                     +1 |
| 14-15          |                     +2 |
| 16-17          |                     +3 |
| 18             |                     +4 |

If no ability score rolled is +2 or better, you can improve your worst score to a +2.
*If I have -3, -1, -1, 0, 0, +1 as my scores, then the -3 becomes a +2*
