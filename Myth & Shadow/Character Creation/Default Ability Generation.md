# Default Ability Generation

Roll 3d6 to generate an [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md). 

| 3d6 Roll Total | Starting Ability Score |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3              | -3                     |
| 4-5            | -2                     |
| 6-8            | -1                     |
| 9-12           | 0                      |
| 13-15          | +1                     |
| 16-17          | +2                     |
| 18             | +3                     |

You can choose which one after you roll. Do this ***three times***. For the other 3 ability scores, they are equal to the negation of one of the 3 ability scores you rolled

*Ex. I rolled a 4, 11, and 14. So I have a -2, 0 and +1. For the other three ability scores, I get a +2, 0, and -1 to distribute.*
