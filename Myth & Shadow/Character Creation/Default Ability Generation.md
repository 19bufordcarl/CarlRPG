# Default Ability Generation

Roll 3d6 to generate an [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md). 

| 3d6 Roll Total | Starting Ability Score |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3              | -3                     |
| 4-5            | -2                     |
| 6-8            | -1                     |
| 9-12           | 0                      |
| 13-15          | +1                     |
| 16-17          | +2                     |
| 18             | +3                     |

You can choose which score goes to which ability after you roll. Do this ***three times***. For the other 3 ability scores, they are equal to the negation of the 3 ability scores you rolled. 

Once all scores are generated, increase one ability score from a 0 to a +2. 
- If no ability score is 0, then you may increase one from a +1 to a +3. 
- If no ability score is +1 then you may increase one from a +2 to a +3.

*Ex. I rolled a 4, 11, and 14. So I have a -2, 0 and +1. For the other three ability scores, I get a +2, 0, and -1 to distribute. I increase one of my 0 scores to a +2. My ability scores are: +2, +2, +1, 0, -1, -2.*

*If you rolled all +/-3, nothing changes and you should buy a lottery ticket.*
