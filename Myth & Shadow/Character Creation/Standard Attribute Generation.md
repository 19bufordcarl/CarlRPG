# Standard Attribute Generation

## Point Buy

Each of your [Point Pools](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Point%20Pools.md) starts at 0. You get 30 points to distribute across your pools. Each pools value is used to derive their corresponding [Attribute Score](../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) of [Health](../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md), [Stamina](../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md), and [Magicka](../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md).

### Standard Arrays

The following standard arrays are useful for new players to ensure basic viability.

#### Warrior

- [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) = 20
- [Stamina Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) = 10
- [Magicka Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) = 0

#### Rogue

- [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) = 10
- [Stamina Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) = 20
- [Magicka Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) = 0

#### Mage

- [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) = 10
- [Stamina Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Stamina%20Points.md) = 0
- [Magicka Points](../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) = 20

## Miscellaneous

It is **HIGHLY** recommended that any new character start with at least 10 HP.
