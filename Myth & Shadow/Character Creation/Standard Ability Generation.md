# Standard Ability Generation

Roll 3d6 and note down the sum. You will do this six times. Note your highest and lowest sum from this process. Use the table below to translate the highest and lowest sums into two *Ability Score* values and assign these values to two of your [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md).

| 3d6 Roll Total | Starting Ability Score |
| :------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3              | -3                     |
| 4-5            | -2                     |
| 6-8            | -1                     |
| 9-12           | 0                      |
| 13-15          | +1                     |
| 16-17          | +2                     |
| 18             | +3                     |

All your other [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) start at 0. You then get a number of ability score increases equal to 3 - (your lowest [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) + your highest [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md)). *(Minimum of 0)*

Each ability score increase (ASI):

- Can be used to increase any legal ability score by 1
- Cannot be used to increase a negative ability score
- Cannot be used to increase an ability score to any higher than +2
