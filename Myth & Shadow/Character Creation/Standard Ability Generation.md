# Standard Ability Generation

## Standard Array

You assign each of the values in the standard array table to one of the 6 [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md).

- 2
- 2
- 1
- 0
- 0
- -2

### Random

You may assign these scores randomly. To do so, for each value roll 1d6. Assign that value to the corresponding ability score. Assign it to the next ability score in the list if that ability already has a score, wrapping around to the start if needed.

1. [Strength](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md)
2. [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md)
3. [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)
4. [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md)
5. [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md)
6. [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md)

## Adjusting Starting Scores

*Optional*
The GM may allow players to modify their scores with this procedure:

1. You may choose to decrease any ability score by 1 to increase another by 1.
2. You may keep repeating step 2 as long as you do not violate the following:
	1. You cannot increase an initial ability score to be higher than +2.
	2. You cannot decrease an initial ability score to be lower than -3.
