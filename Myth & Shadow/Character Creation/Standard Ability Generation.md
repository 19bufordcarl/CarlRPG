# Standard Ability Generation

## Standard Array

You assign each of the values in the standard array table to one of the 6 [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md).

| [Primary Skill](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md) | Secondary | Tertiary | Mediocre | Mediocre | Dump |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | ---: |
|                                                                      2 |         2 |        1 |        0 |        0 |   -2 |

## Adjusting Starting Scores

*Optional*
The GM may allow players to modify their scores with this procedure:

1. You may choose to decrease any ability score by 1 to increase another by 1.
2. You may keep repeating step 2 as long as you do not violate the following:
	1. You cannot increase an initial ability score to be higher than +2.
	2. You cannot decrease an initial ability score to be lower than -3.
