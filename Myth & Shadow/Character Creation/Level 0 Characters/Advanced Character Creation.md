## Who Are You?

- [ ] Choose your character's [Ancestry](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md).
- [ ] Choose the [Background](../../Player%20Characters/Background.md) your character had, but DONT choose a [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md).
	- [ ] You'll get this once you hit level 1.
- [ ] Create a name for your character and choose some appearance traits.

## Ability Scores

- [ ] Roll for [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md):
	- [ ] Use [Old School Ability Generation](Level%200%20Characters/Old%20School%20Ability%20Generation.md)

## Quick Maths

- [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
	- [ ] [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = 10
		- [ ] (This will change if you buy [Armor](../../Items/Armor.md))
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) = 0
		- [ ] Only characters with enough combat experience to be level 1 have FP
	- [ ] [Health Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = 1d8 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)
		- [ ] Your health is random! (Minimum 1)
	- [ ] [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Scars](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) = 30' (feet)
		- [ ] If your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) is +2 or +3, you have 35'.
			- [ ] (This will change if you buy [Armor](../../Items/Armor.md))

## Show Me what You Got

- [ ] Get your starting Kit:
	- [ ] Standard Kit (Commoner Wealth):
		- [ ] 3d6 x 10 coins (or 100 coins) to buy [Weapons](../../Items/Weapons.md), [Armor](../../Items/Armor.md), and [Gear](../../Items/Standard%20Gear.md)
		- [ ] [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md)
	- [ ] Inheritance (Optional)
		- [ ] Choose 1
			- [ ] [Padded Armor](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Mundane%20Armors/Padded%20Armor.md)
			- [ ] 250 coins worth of [Weapons](../../Items/Weapons.md) and ammo, and a [Mundane Shield](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Mundane%20Armors/Mundane%20Shield.md)
			- [ ] A single [1st Level Spell](../../Magic/Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md) (and a [Spellcasting Discipline](../../Magic/The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) if you so choose)
	- [ ] The party does NOT start with a [Horse](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/250%20Coins/Horse,%20Draft.md) and [Wagon](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/250%20Coins/Wagon.md)
