## Who Are You?

- [ ] Choose your character's [Ancestry](../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md).

	- [ ] Use [Old School Ability Generation](Old%20School%20Ability%20Generation.md)

## Quick Maths

- [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
	- [ ] [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = 10
		- [ ] (This will change if you buy [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md))
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Fatigue Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) = 0
		- [ ] Only characters with enough combat experience to be level 1 have FP
	- [ ] [Health Points](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = 1d8 + [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Constitution.md)
		- [ ] Your health is random! (Minimum 1)
	- [ ] [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Scars](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) = 30' (feet)
		- [ ] If your [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Dexterity.md) is +2 or +3, you have 35'.
			- [ ] (This will change if you buy [Armor](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md))

## Show Me what You Got
