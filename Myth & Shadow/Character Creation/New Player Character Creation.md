		- [ ] (if FP would negative, then it is just 0)
	- [ ] [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = 5 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)
	- [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) = 1
	- [ ] [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) = 30' (feet) + (5' x [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md))
