# New Player Character Creation

A Player Character is referred to as a PC. All other characters are Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

Make a copy of the [Base Character Sheet](Characters/Base%20Character%20Sheet.md) to fill out as you go.

## Ability Scores

- [ ] Determine [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md):
	- [ ] Use [Standard Ability Generation](Standard%20Ability%20Generation.md)

## Who Are You?

- [ ] Choose your character's [Ancestry](../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md). *(The lore sections contain no mechanics).*
- [ ] Choose the [Background](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Background.md) your character had (with it comes a [Primary Skill](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md)).
- [ ] Create a name for your character and choose some appearance traits.

## Quick Maths

- [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
	- [ ] [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) (AC)
		- [ ] Starts at 10 *(This will change if you get [Armor](../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md))*
	- [ ] [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) (FP)
		- [ ] Equals [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) + [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) + [Strength](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md)
		- [ ] *(Treat any negative ability scores here as 0)*
	- [ ] [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) (HP)
		- [ ] Equals 5 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)
	- [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) (LV)
		- [ ] PCs start at level 1
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) (XP)
		- [ ] PCs start with 0 XP
	- [ ] [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md)
		- [ ] PCs start with no scars
	- [ ] [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md)
		- [ ] PCs have a movement speed of 30 feet
		- [ ] If your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) is +2 or +3, you have 35 feet.
			- [ ] (Heavier [Armors](../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md) negate speed benefits)
