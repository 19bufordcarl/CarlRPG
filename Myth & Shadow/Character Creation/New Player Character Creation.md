# New Player Character Creation

A Player Character is referred to as a PC. All other characters are Non-Player Characters (NPCs). Hostile NPCs are often referred to as monsters.

Make a copy of the [Base Character Sheet](Base%20Character%20Sheet.md) to fill out as you go.

## Ability Scores

- [ ] Determine [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md):
	- [ ] Use [Standard Ability Generation](Standard%20Ability%20Generation.md)

## Who Are You?

- [ ] Choose your character's [Ancestry](../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md).
- [ ] Choose the [Background](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Background.md) your character had — with it comes a [Primary Ability](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Ability.md).
- [ ] Create a name for your character and choose some appearance traits.

## Quick Maths

- [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
	- [ ] [Physical Defense](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) (PD)
		- [ ] Equals the [Median](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of [Strength](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)
	- [ ] [Mental Defense](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) (MD)

	- [ ] [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) (AC)
		- [ ] Equals 10 + [Half](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Physical Defense](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) + [Armor](../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md)
	- [ ] [Hit Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) (HP)
		- [ ] Equals 5 + 2 x ([Level](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md))
	- [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) (LV)
		- [ ] Start at level 1
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Experience%20Points.md) (XP)
		- [ ] Start with 0 XP
	- [ ] [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Progression/Scars.md)
