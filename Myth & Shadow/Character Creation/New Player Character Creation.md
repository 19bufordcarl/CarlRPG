# New Player Character Creation

A Player Character is referred to as a PC. All other characters are Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

Make a copy of the [Base Character Sheet](Base%20Character%20Sheet.md) to fill out as you go.

## Ability Scores

- [ ] Determine [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md):
	- [ ] Use [Standard Ability Generation](Standard%20Ability%20Generation.md)

## Who Are You?

- [ ] Choose your character's [Ancestry](../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md). *(The lore sections contain no mechanics).*
- [ ] Choose the [Background](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Background.md) your character had (with it comes a [Primary Skill](../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md)).
- [ ] Create a name for your character and choose some appearance traits.

## Quick Maths

- [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
	- [ ] [Physical Defense](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) (PD)
		- [ ] Equals the [Median](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of [Strength](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)
	- [ ] [Mental Defense](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) (MD)
		- [ ] Equals the [Median](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md#Median) of [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md)
	- [ ] [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) (AC)
		- [ ] Equals 10 + [Physical Defense](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md)
		- [ ] *[Armor](../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md) grants more AC bonuses*
	- [ ] [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) (FP)
		- [ ] Equals [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) + [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) + [Strength](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md)
		- [ ] *Treat any negative ability scores as 0 for this*
	- [ ] [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) (HP)
		- [ ] Equals 5 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)
	- [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) (LV)
		- [ ] PCs start at level 1
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) (XP)
		- [ ] PCs start with 0 XP
	- [ ] [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md)
		- [ ] PCs start with no scars
	- [ ] [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md)
		- [ ] PCs have a movement speed of 30 feet
		- [ ] If your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) is +2 or +3, you have 35 feet.
			- [ ] (Heavier [Armors](../Items%20and%20Gear/Armor/Armor.md) negate speed benefits)
