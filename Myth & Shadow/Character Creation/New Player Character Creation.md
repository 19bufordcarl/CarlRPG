# New Player Character Creation
Make a copy of the [Base Character Sheet](Characters/Base%20Character%20Sheet.md) to fill out.
## Who Are You?
- [ ] Choose your character's [Ancestry](../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md).

## Ability Scores

	- [ ] See [Default Ability Generation](Default%20Ability%20Generation.md)
## Quick Maths
- [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
	- [ ] [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = 10
		- [ ] (This will change if you buy [Armor](../Items/Armor.md))
	- [ ] [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) = [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) + [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) + [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md)
		- [ ] (Don't add ability scores if they're negative)
	- [ ] [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = 5 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)
	- [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) = 1
	- [ ] [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Experience Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) = 0
	- [ ] [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) = 30 feet (aka 30')
		- [ ] If your [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) is +2 or +3, you have 35'.
			- [ ] (This will revert to 30' if you wear heavy [Armor](../Items/Armor.md))
