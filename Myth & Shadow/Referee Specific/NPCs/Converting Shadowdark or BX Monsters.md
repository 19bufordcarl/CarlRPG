# Converting Shadowdark and BX Monsters
## Shadowdark
Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.
- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) = Same
	- When they "miss", they still deal damage equal to [Half](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
		- + 1 if its a melee attack
	- Nat 1s deal no damage.
	- Ranged attack rolls less than 10 miss the PC, they deal no damage.
	- Don't bother using damage modifiers, they have their own damage scaling with multi-attack. There is an SRD of common monsters to reference as well that balances this.
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) = Same (usually)
	- If an ability 4+ for a high level creature, just use the creature's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
	- If it is a high level creature with 4+ strength, give it [Advantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on non-[Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same
	- *Optional*
		- If they are listed with a shield, give them the [Shield Block](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20X%20Property.md#Shield%20Block) [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md).
		- If you do, also reduce their AC by 1 or 2 depending on the tier of enemy.
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same
	- Or round up to the nearest 5HP
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) = near means 30'
	- *Optional, use if using variable [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md).*
	- If the creature is 
		- unarmored,
		- humanoid,
		- and has positive [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md),
		- then add (5' x [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md)) to this.
- Special Abilities = Same, see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Conditions/!Conditions.md) applies, or make a ruling.
	- Stat Damage = auto hits, but only deals 1 damage instead of a d4 (2 if its more than a d4). 
- Note: Monsters do NOT have a [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) unless otherwise stated. This is unique to PCs.

That being said, there is an SRD of common monsters for this system for better compatibility, specifically around the weirdness of attack damage with ability scores. Generally, this results in the reduction of multi-attacks and addition of damage bonus to help streamline combats.
