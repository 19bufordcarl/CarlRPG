# Converting Shadowdark and BX Monsters
## Shadowdark
Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, they can more or less be used as is.
- [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) = Same
	- When they miss a melee attack, they can use their [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) to [Melee Bash](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md#Melee%20Bash) to deal damage equal to [Halving](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1. Remember that reactions are once per round.
		- Nat 1s always miss, you cannot use a melee bash then.
	- Don't use damage modifiers, monsters have their own damage scaling with multi-attack.
- [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) = Same (usually)
	- If an ability 4+ for a high level creature, use the creature's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) or attack bonus, whichever feels more accurate.
	- If it is a high level creature that is quite large with 4+ strength, give it [Advantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on non-[Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
- [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = Same
	- *Optional*
		- Light = 12, Chain = 14, Plate = 16 in this system.
		- If they are listed with a shield, give them the [Shield Block](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20X%20Property.md#Shield%20Block) [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md).
- [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = Same
	- Or round up to the nearest 5HP
- [DCs](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) = Same
- [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) = near means 30'
	- *Optional, use if using variable [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) for tactical grided play.*
	- If the creature is 
		1. not wearing heavy armor,
		2. humanoid,
		3. has positive [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md),
		- then add (5' x [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md)) to the 30' default move speed.
- Special Abilities = Same, see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Conditions/!Conditions.md) applies, or make a ruling.
	- Stat Damage = automatically hits, but only deals 1 damage instead of d4 damage.
		- (deal 2 if its significantly more than a d4 of damage). 
- Note: Monsters do NOT have a [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) unless otherwise stated. This is unique to PCs.

That being said, there is an SRD of common monsters for this system for better compatibility, specifically around the treatment of ability scores as classes in this system.
