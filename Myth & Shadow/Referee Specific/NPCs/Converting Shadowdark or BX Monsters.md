# Converting Shadowdark and BX Monsters
## Shadowdark
Converting monsters from Shadowdark is relatively simple, but takes a bit of math.
- AC = Creature's Level x 2
- Ability Score = The higher of the listed ability score or their Level 
	- (Only for abilities with positive modifiers)
- HP = HP + Level (They'll take more hits with lower AC)
- Attacks = Same, but add it's calculated ability score (often just level) to all damage rolls.
- Abilities = Same, see if an appropriate [Condition](../../Conditions/!Conditions.md) applies, or make a ruling.
- Stat Damage = Same, 
	- it'll be more punishing, but that's fine, PCs have more effective HP in MnS.
- DCs = round up to the next one of 10, 15, 20.
- Movement = near means 30'
