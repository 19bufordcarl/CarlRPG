# The Charisma Discipline
The [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) discipline channels spellcasting through raw spiritual connection.
## Limited Spells
You choose one of [The Elements](../Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md#The%20Elements) ***or*** one of [The Energies](../Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md#The%20Energies). You cannot memorize or cast spells that do not share your chosen domain.
## Altered Spellcasting
For [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share your domain:
- You use your [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
- You use your [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) if referenced in spell text.
- You use your [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining [Max Spell Memorization](../../Spell%20Memorization.md).
- You use your [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining your [Maximum Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).
