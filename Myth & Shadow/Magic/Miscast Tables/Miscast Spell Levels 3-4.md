| 2   | **Big Explosion:** You take 2d12 [Fire](../../Damage%20Types/Fire) damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | **Mirrored Refraction:** The spell is copied. One copy targets yourself.

| 4   | **Incorrect Cast:** Cast a random spell you have [Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md) at the chosen targets for the original spell, even if this would normally be illegal.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 6   | **Mutagenesis:** A random [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) becomes -3 until your next [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest).                                                                                                                                                               |
| 7   | **Big Hole:** A 15 foot radius 30 foot deep cylindrical sinkhole opens on you. All creatures in the affected area fall in.

| 9   | **Stupefaction:** You cannot cast [3rd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%203/3rd%20Level%20Spells.md) or higher until you complete a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10  | **Madness:** You glimpse the unfathomable, make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) or descend in mad ravings for 1d4 delve [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md). While raving, you are [Incapacitated](../../Conditions/Incapacitated.md). |
| 11  | **Arcane Magnet:** All hostile creatures are drawn to you like a flame. They attempt to [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) you if at all possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12  | **Arcane Instability:** You have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for [3rd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%203/3rd%20Level%20Spells.md) or lower.                                                                                      |
