# Disciplines

A discipline represent alternative ways that a character can wield the forces of magic.

A PC can choose a discipline at [New Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md). A PC can only have one spellcasting discipline at a time.

A PC can change their discipline or learn a new discipline over [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Temple%20Services.md) or [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) that follows a different discipline. This can only be done when the PC [Levels Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), and they will need to pay for initiation & training (500 coins).

## The Three Spellcasting Disciplines

*In the default setting, the [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) follows this discipline*

### Wisdom

*In the default setting, most [Temples](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Temple%20Services.md) follow this discipline*

### Charisma

The [Charisma Discipline](Charisma%20Discipline.md) lets the PC use [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) for [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) for 2 [Domains](../Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md).
*In the default setting, some [Temples](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Temple%20Services.md) follow this discipline*
