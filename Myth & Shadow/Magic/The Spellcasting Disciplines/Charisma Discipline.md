# The Charisma Discipline

The [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) discipline channels spellcasting through raw spiritual connection.

## Limited Spells

When you first join this discipline, you choose any two [Spell Domains](../Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md#Spell%20Domains). You cannot memorize or cast [Spells](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that do not share one of your chosen domains.

## Altered Spellcasting

For [Spells](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that share one of your domains, your [Charisma](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) is your [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
