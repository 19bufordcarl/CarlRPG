# The Wisdom Discipline

The [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) discipline channels spellcasting through willpower and intuition.

## Limited Spells

When you first join this discipline, you choose any two [Spell Domains](../Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md#Spell%20Domains). You cannot memorize or cast [Spells](../Spells.md) that do not share one of your chosen domains.

## Altered Spellcasting

For [Spells](../Spells.md) in your domains:

- You use your [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
- You use your [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) if referenced in spell text.
- You use your [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining [Max Spell Memorization](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
- You use your [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining your [Maximum Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).
