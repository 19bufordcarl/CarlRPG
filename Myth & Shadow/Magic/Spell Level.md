# Spell Level

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. Typically, a [Spell](Spells.md) of certain level is accessible to a Caster according to the following rules.
## Max Spell Level

| Minimum of [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) | Max Spell Level                                                               | Mythril Costs |

A PCs maximum spell level is equal to the minimum of their [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) divided by 2.

You can only upcast spells to a level less than or equal to your max level.

*Author's Note:*
*These two types of 'level' is a somewhat unfortunate naming scheme inherited from historical RPGs. It is more mental effort to change this language than deal with it in my opinion.*
