# Deity

## Deity's Boon

### Unique Boon

Should not be too strong or make it too obvious that the deity is actually real.
*See [On Demons](Deity%20Template.md#On%20Demons)*

## Deity's Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Deity's Domains](#Deity's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Deity's Domains

- Usually 2. The boon should get weaker if it is more.

### Heresy

Leaving Deity's faith grants you the cursed ==feature== of a heretic.

- Your AbilityScore becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Deity's Boon](#Deity's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Deity's Ethos

Flavor

### On Demons

If the deity is a demon, then their boon can be much stronger. Demons involve themselves directly in the mortal plane, and thus are able to exert more influence over it. Demons should be especially demanding of their followers, and clearly evil. The GM should not let a player worship a demon unless all players are demon worshippers for this campaign.
