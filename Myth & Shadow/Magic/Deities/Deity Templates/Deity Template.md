**Your prime requisite must be at least 3 to follow Deity.**
*To follow a Deity, choose a mental ability ([Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md), or [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)). This is known as your prime requisite.*
## Deity's Boons
### Altered Spellcasting
For [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of [Deity's Domains](Deity%20Template.md#Deity's%20Domains):
- You use your prime requisite in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
- You use your prime requisite in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) if referenced in the spell text.
- You use your prime requisite in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining [Max Spell Memorization](../../Spell%20Memorization.md).
- You use your prime requisite in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining your [Maximum Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).
