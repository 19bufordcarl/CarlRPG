# Pantheons

A PC chooses a pantheon as the basis for their faith. Within that pantheon, they can then choose a patron deity. Belonging to a certain faith grants PCs certain status and rights in the appropriate society, as well as potentially useful ritual knowledge.

A PC can swear faith to a Pantheon at [New Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md), or over [Downtime](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md) that worships that Pantheon.

There are some deities that are worshipped by no pantheon. They are called demons, and are worshipped only by cults who are barred from civilization.

A creature can only belong to one Pantheon at a time.

*Pantheon's are always campaign specific, and the GM may use a different list.*

### Imperial Pantheon

The Imperial Pantheon is the prime pantheon of the world of Mithrinia given the Empire's dominance over the region. It values

## Lore

*The deities of the world of Myth and Shadow are fickle and ancient. The good ([Life](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md) domain) deities' influence is hardly felt in modern times. While no respectable scholar would outright deny their existence, there are certainly those who question their exact "divine" nature. Many theories exist as to whether or not ancient myths are to be trusted and the gods used to be more involved, or if they are merely tall tales of pseudo-history*

*The evil ([Death](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain) deities, colloquially know as Demons, influence is much more direct in the modern world. Their legions of cultist and unholy monsters are a constant threat to all mortals. They are very likely the cause of the [Shadowcurse](../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Their followers build hidden blasphemous temples, and these traitorous heretics have admitted to conversing with these foul Demons directly. They are invariably tempted by the evil powers, no doubt. The Arcane Guild and Imperial Temple are united in resisting the threat of necromancy, and oppose it at all costs.*

*There are some dubious accounts of outright "miracles" being performed through the grace of a good gods, but this is not widely accepted by the arcane community. There are certainly healing rituals performed at temples across the Empire for her peoples, but these rituals are learnable magicks, using standard Mythril techniques. The priests swear that their rituals and prayer teaches them how to weave the magic more effectively, and the High Imperial Archpriest can call me a heretic all he likes, so long as I oppose necromancy we are united where it counts. I believe these "rituals" are nothing more than Mythril at work. The gods ability to impact the mortal realm has simply gone unsubstantiated for far too long.*

## GM Specific

For certain campaigns, it may be inappropriate to have PCs start as a follower of a Pantheon, simply make sure you alert your players of this prior to character creation.

See the [Deity Template](Deity%20Templates/Deity%20Template.md) for the default Deity rules or if you wish to make your own.

You can also decide that Deities do not grant any boon / heresy, and the only impact is faction allegiance, and the PCs connection to the world and lore.
