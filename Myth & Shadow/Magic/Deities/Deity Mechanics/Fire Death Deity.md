## Their Boons

### Destroyer of Worlds

*Must have at least 5 [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md)*
You may use d12s in place of the specified damage dice for your [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md).

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Their Domains](Fire%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Their faith curses you with the foul heart of a heretic.

Your [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

You cannot benefit from [Their Boons](Fire%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Boons) until you complete a quest of Their choosing.
