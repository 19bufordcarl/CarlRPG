# Death Deity

## Their Boons

### Death Always Wins

*Must be at least 5th [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)*
You may take a -5 to [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to have the spell deal an additional 10 damage if it is successfully cast.

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Their Domains](Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Their faith grants you a heretic's permanent exile. You die and they claim your soul.

## Their Domains
