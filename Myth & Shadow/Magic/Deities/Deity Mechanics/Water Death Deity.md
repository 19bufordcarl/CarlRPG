# Water Death Deity

## Their Boons

### Forbidden Knowledge

*Must have at least 5 [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md)*
You can attempt to learn [Mythic Spells](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Mythic/{Mythic%20Spells}.md) from Their apocryphal knowledge of the Deep.

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell from the [Life](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md) domain, you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Their faith curses you with the perfect madness of a doomed fool.

Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

You cannot benefit from [Their Boons](Water%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Boons) until you complete a quest of Their choosing.
