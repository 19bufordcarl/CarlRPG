# Life Death Deity

## Their Boons

### Elemental Bane

*Must be at least 3rd [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)*
You know the spell [Absorb Elements](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/Absorb%20Elements.md). You can cast without it fail. You still consume [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) when casting this spell.

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Their Domains](Life%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Their faith curses you with the floundering tongue of a heretic.

Your [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Charisma.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

You cannot benefit from [Their Boons](Life%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Boons) until you complete a quest of Their choosing.

## Their Domains

- [Life](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md)
- [Death](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md)
