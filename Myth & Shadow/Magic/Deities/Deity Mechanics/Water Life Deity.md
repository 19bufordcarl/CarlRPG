# Water Life Deity

## Their Boons

### The Water of Life

*Must be at least 2nd [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)*
You can create [Holy Water](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Holy%20Water%20Vial.md) with 200 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Mythril.md). Crafting time is one [Delve Round](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) per vial. Reduce the cost to 100 coins at 5th level, and 50 coins at 10th level.

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Their Domains](Water%20Life%20Deity.md#Their%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Deity's faith grants you a heretic's exile.

You cannot benefit from [Their Boons](Water%20Life%20Deity.md#Their%20Boons) until you complete a quest of Their choosing.

## Their Domains

- [Water](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md)
- [Life](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md)
