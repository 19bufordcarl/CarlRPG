# Earth Death Deity

## Their Boons

### Death Comes For Us All

*Must have at least 5 [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md)*
You may replace any instance of [Acid](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Acid.md), [Mundane](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md), or [Mythril](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) damage with [Necrotic](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage on [Spells](../../Spells.md) that you know.

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Their Domains](Earth%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Their faith curses you with the foul heart of a heretic.

Your [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

You cannot benefit from [Their Boons](Earth%20Death%20Deity.md#Their%20Boons) until you complete a quest of Their choosing.

## Their Domains

- [Earth](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md)
- [Death](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md)
