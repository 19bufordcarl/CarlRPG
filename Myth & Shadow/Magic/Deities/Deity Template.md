# Deity

## Their Boons

### Unique Boon

*Prerequisite*
Should be explainable by studying the techniques rather than divine intervention.
*See [On Demons](Deity%20Template.md#On%20Demons)*

## Their Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Their Domains](#Their%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Heresy

Leaving Their faith grants you the cursed ==feature== of a heretic.

- Your AbilityScore becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Their Boon](#Their%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Their Domains

- Usually 2. The boon should get weaker if it is more.

## On Demons

If the deity is a demon, then their boon can be much stronger. Demons involve themselves directly in the mortal plane, and thus are able to exert more influence over it. Demons should be especially demanding of their followers, and clearly evil. The GM should not let a player worship a demon unless all players are demon worshippers for this campaign.

The Deities of Mithrinia, while widely worshipped, do not directly intervene. Many people believe they have abandoned the mortal plane. Some believe they never really existed in the first place.
