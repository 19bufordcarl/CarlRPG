# Cendraeri Pantheon

The Cendraeri Pantheon chiefly worships only one Deity, the [Cendraeri](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elf.md#Ash%20Elf%20(Cendraeri)) patron [Nyx](Mithrinian%20Deities/Nyx.md), goddess of Twilight. They acknowledge many other Deity's in their pantheon, but only insofar as their relationship (and inferiority) to Nyx.

Notably, the Cendraeri have significant rites and pilgrimages that followers undergo that directly reference several demons. These are denoted as antagonist deities, as rather than outright worshipping them, the rites serve to illuminate Nyx's divine power to protect the Cendraeri people from the evil demons.
