## Gaia's Ethos

Goddess of the Earth. Symbolized by loyalty, faith, and stalwart character. Patron of the faithful, and those who defend their allies. The [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) who took up the [Imperial Pantheon](../Imperial%20Pantheon.md) tend to choose Gaia as their patron deity. Her teachings inform which types of stonework are sacred and which are blasphemous. The city of Cragstone is adorned with Her likeness.
