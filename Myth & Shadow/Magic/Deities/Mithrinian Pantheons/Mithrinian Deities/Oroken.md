# Oroken

## Oroken's Mechanics

Oroken is an [Earth Death Deity](../../Deity%20Mechanics/Earth%20Death%20Deity.md).

## Oroken's Ethos

Curse, Poison, Disease, Death. Oroken's followers includes many of those who are cursed from tampering with magic beyond their understanding, the lycanthropes chief among them. The [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) hold a special hatred for Oroken, as their myths state that a tribe of Oroken followers cursed a tribe of [Elves](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md) who became the [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)), thus their name.

Some [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) have embraced Oroken, however, turning to pillaging, raiding, and poisoning.
