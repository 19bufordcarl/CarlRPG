# Drow Pantheon

The Drow Pantheon chiefly worships only one Deity, the [Drow](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Elves.md#Ash%20Elf%20(Drow)) patron [Nyx](Mithrinian%20Deities/Nyx.md), goddess of Twilight.

Notably, the Drow have significant rites and pilgrimages that followers undergo that directly reference several demons. These are denoted as antagonist deities, as rather than outright worshipping them, the rites serve to illuminate Nyx's divine power to protect the Drow people from the evil demons.
