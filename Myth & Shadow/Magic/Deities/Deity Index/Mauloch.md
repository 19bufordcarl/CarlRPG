# Mauloch

**You must have at least 5 [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Strength.md) to follow Mauloch**

## Mauloch's Boon

### Destroyer of Worlds

You may use d12s in place of the specified damage dice for your [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
*The number of dice remains unchanged*

## Mauloch's Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Mauloch's Domains](#Mauloch's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Mauloch's Domains

- [Fire](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)
- [Death](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Mauloch's faith curses you with the foul heart of a heretic.

- Your [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Constitution.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Mauloch's Boon](#Mauloch's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Mauloch's Ethos

Hellfire and destruction. Mauloch's followers seek to destroy the living and send their souls for him to feed on in his realm of brimstone and fire. In return he grants them powers untold.
