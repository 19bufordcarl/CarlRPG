### A Will as Strong as Stone

*Unlocked at 2nd [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)*

## Gaera's Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Gaera's Domains](#Gaera's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Gaera's Domains

- [Earth](../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md)
- [Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Gaera's faith grants you a heretic's exile.

- You cannot benefit from [Gaera's Boon](#Gaera's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Gaera's Ethos

Goddess of the Earth. Symbolized by loyalty, faith, and stalwart character. Patron of the faithful, and those who defend their allies. [Orcish](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) culture is most appreciative of Gaera's rituals, which have taught them how to live in the mountains, mine their riches, and work their stones.
