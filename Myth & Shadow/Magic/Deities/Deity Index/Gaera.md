## Gaera's Ethos
Goddess of the Earth. Symbolized by loyalty, faith, and stalwart character. Patron of the faithful, and those who defend their allies. [Orcish](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)%20[Ancestry](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) culture is most appreciative of Gaera's rituals, which have taught them how to live in the mountains, mine their riches, and work their stones.
