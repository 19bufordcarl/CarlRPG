## Thuulc's Banes
### Limited Spells
You cannot memorize or cast spells that do not share one of [Thuulc's Domains](#Thuulc's%20Domains).
### Heresy
Leaving Thuulc's faith grants you the cursed madness of a heretic.
- Your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
## Thuulc's Ethos
Thuulc, demon of the deep. While his chief domain is [Water](../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md), he is the hoarder of all forbidden and arcane knowledge, and grants his followers abilities to glimpse the un-glimpseable.

Many a mage have been tempted by the draw of the forbidden knowledge that Thuulc offers. There is some knowledge that the [Arcane Guild](../../../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) has banned for reason, and you should let sleeping dogs lie, lest the great beast of the deep wrap his tentacles around your mind.
