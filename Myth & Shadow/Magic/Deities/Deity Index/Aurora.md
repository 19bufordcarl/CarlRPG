# Aurora

## Aurora's Boon

### As Quick as the Wind

*Must be at least 3rd [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)*
You ignore the movement restriction of [Slow Actions](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action).

## Aurora's Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Aurora's Domains](#Aurora's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Aurora's Domains

- [Air](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Air.md)
- [Life](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Aurora's faith grants you a heretic's exile.

You cannot benefit from [Aurora's Boon](#Aurora's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of Aurora's choosing.

## Aurora's Ethos

Goddess of the sky, nature, and the winds. Symbolized by understanding and peace. Patron of those who are free spirited and value harmony. [Sylvan](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Forest%20Elf%20(Sylvan)) culture is most appreciative of the rituals associated with Aurora. *Sky above, wind within.*
