### Heresy

Leaving Gaia's faith grants you a heretic's exile.

## Gaia's Ethos

Goddess of the Earth. Symbolized by loyalty, faith, and stalwart character. Patron of the faithful, and those who defend their allies. [Orcish](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) culture is most appreciative of Gaia's rituals, which have taught them how to live in the mountains, mine their riches, and work their stones.
