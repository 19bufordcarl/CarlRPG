# Vaern
## Vaern's Boon
### Psionic Master
You automatically succeed on the [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for [Spells](../../Spells.md) that create illusions or charm.
## Vaern's Banes
### Limited Spells
If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Vaern's Domains](#Vaern's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).
### Vaern's Domains
- [Air](../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)
- [Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md)
### Heresy
Leaving Vaern's faith curses you with the pained lethargy of a heretic.
- Your [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Vaern's Boon](#Vaern's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.
## Vaern's Ethos
The web weaver, the prince of darkness, deceit, and undeath. The malevolent vampires acknowledge Vaern as the font of their power, and the arcane community believes Vaern to be the most serious threat to civilization. Illusions rule in his realm. Vaern is proof the pen is mightier than the sword.
