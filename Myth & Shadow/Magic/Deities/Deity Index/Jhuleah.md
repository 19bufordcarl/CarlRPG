## Jhuleah's Boon

### The Water of Life

*Unlocked at 3rd [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) after studying the rites of Jhuleah*
You can create [Holy Water](../../../Items/Gear/250%20Coins/Holy%20Water%20Vial.md) with 200 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Mythril.md). Crafting takes 1 day per vial and prevents you from a [Full Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest). Reduce the cost to 100 coins at 5th level, and 50 coins at 10th level.

- [Life](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Jhuleah's faith grants you a heretic's exile.
