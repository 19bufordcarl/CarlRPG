# Erevanthe
## Erevanthe's Boon
### Ash Born
You know the spell [Absorb Elements](../../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/Absorb%20Elements.md). It doesn't count against your [Spell Memorization](../../Spell%20Memorization.md) maximum, you automatically succeed on [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for it, but you can only choose [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md).
## Erevanthe's Banes
### Limited Spells
If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Erevanthe's Domains](#Erevanthe's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](Erevanthe.md#Heresy).
### Erevanthe's Domains
- [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)
- [Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md)
- [Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md)
### Heresy
Leaving Erevanthe's faith curses you with the floundering tongue of a heretic.
- Your [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Erevanthe's Boon](Erevanthe.md#Erevanthe's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.
## Erevanthe's Ethos
Queen of shadows, secrets, and the power of words not said. The power between true and false, light and shadow, good and evil. The [Ash Elves](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Ash%20Elf%20[Ancestry](Ancestry.md)) claim her as the founder of their culture and the one responsible for their 'blessed' forms.

Erevanthe expects strict devotion from her followers, obedience is valued above all, shadows and secrets hold the keys to power, she knows all, and you need to know not.
