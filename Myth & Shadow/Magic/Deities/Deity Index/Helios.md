## Helios' Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Helios' Domains](#Helios'%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](Helios.md#Heresy).

### Helios' Domains

- [Fire](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)
- [Life](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Helios' faith curses you with the rotten luck of a heretic.

- All your [Checks](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) are made with [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) until you break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Helios' Boon](Helios.md#Helios'%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Helios' Ethos

Helios is the chief god of the Empire. He is symbolized by honor, valor, and justice. He is the patron of those who fight fearlessly for their values, and his followers founded this great Empire.

Most [Humans](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Human.md) will have grown up chiefly worshipping Helios.
