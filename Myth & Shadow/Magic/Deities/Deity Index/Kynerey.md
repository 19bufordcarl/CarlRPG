# Kynerey
## Kynerey's Boon
### Quick as the Wind
You may use your [Movement](../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) and still cast [Spells](../../Spells.md) in [Combat](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md) even if they are a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action).
## Kynerey's Banes
### Limited Spells
If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Kynerey's Domains](#Kynerey's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).
### Kynerey's Domains
- [Air](../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)
- [Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md)
### Heresy
Leaving Kynerey's faith grants you a heretic's exile.
- You cannot benefit from [Kynerey's Boon](#Kynerey's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.
## Kynerey's Ethos
Goddess of the sky, nature, and the winds. Symbolized by understanding and peace. Patron of those who are free spirited and value harmony. [Forest Elf (Sylvan)](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Forest%20Elf%20(Sylvan)) culture is most appreciative of the rituals associated with Kynerey, sky above, wind within.
