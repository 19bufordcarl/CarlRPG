## Oroken's Ethos
Curse, Poison, Disease, Death. Oroken's followers includes many of those who are cursed from tampering with magic beyond their understanding, the lycanthropes chief among them. The [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)%20[Ancestry](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) hold a special hatred for Oroken, as their myths state that a tribe of Oroken followers cursed a tribe of [Elves](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md) who became the [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)%20[Ancestry](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)), thus their name.

Some [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)%20[Ancestry](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) have embraced Oroken, however, turning to pillaging, raiding, and poisoning.
