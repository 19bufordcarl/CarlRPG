# Oroken

**You must have at least 5 [Constitution](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) to follow Oroken**

## Oroken's Boon

### Death Comes For Us All

Any [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that deal [Necrotic](../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage also inflict [Poisoned](../../../Conditions/Poisoned.md) X where X is the [Spell's Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

## Oroken's Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Oroken's Domains](#Oroken's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Oroken's Domains

- [Earth](../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md)
- [Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Oroken's faith curses you with the weakened body of a heretic.

- Your [Strength](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Oroken's Boon](#Oroken's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Oroken's Ethos

Curse, Poison, Disease, Death. Oroken's followers includes many of those who are cursed from tampering with magic beyond their understanding, the lycanthropes chief among them. The [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) hold a special hatred for Oroken, as their myths state that a tribe of Oroken followers cursed a tribe of [Elves](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md) who became the [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)), thus their name.

Some [Orcs](../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Elf.md#Deep%20Elf%20(Orc)) have embraced Oroken, however, turning to pillaging, raiding, and poisoning.
