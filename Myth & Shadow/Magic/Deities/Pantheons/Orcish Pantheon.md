# Orcish Pantheon

The Orcish Pantheon has largely fallen out of popularity. The orcs of their ancient traditions recognize Oroken as their prime deity for the creation of the orcish curse. His ways are violent and uncaring, and is largely scorned by contemporary Orcish society.

The Orcish Pantheon chiefly worships Oroken, however it also worships his many demon spawn children that he has sired in his conquests.
