# Imperial Pantheon

The Imperial Pantheon is the prime pantheon of the world of Mithrinia given the Empire's dominance over the region.

There are many minor Deities in the religion, but they are all denoted as the divine offspring of the four chief Deities -- one for each of [The Elements](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md#The%20Elements).
