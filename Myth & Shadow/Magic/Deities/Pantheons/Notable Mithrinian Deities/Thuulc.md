# Thuulc

## Thuulc's Mechanics

Thuulc is a [Water Death Deity](../../Deity%20Mechanics/Water%20Death%20Deity.md).

## Thuulc's Ethos

Thuulc, demon of the deep. While his chief domain is [Water](../../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md), he is the hoarder of all forbidden and arcane knowledge, and grants his followers abilities to glimpse the un-glimpseable.

Many a mage have been tempted by the draw of the forbidden knowledge that Thuulc offers. There is some knowledge that the [Arcane Guild](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) has banned for reason. Word to the wise; let sleeping dogs lie, lest the great beast of the deep wrap his tentacles around your mind.
