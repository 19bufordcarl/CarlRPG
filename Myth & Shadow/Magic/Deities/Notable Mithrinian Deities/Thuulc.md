# Thuulc

**You must have at least 5 [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Intelligence.md) to follow Thuulc**

## Thuulc's Boon

### Forbidden Knowledge

You can attempt to learn [Mythic Spells](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Mythic/!Mythic%20Spells.md) from Thuulc's apocryphal libraries.

## Thuulc's Banes

### Limited Spells

If you memorize or cast a spell that does not share one of [Thuulc's Domains](#Thuulc's%20Domains), you are a [Heretic](#Heresy).

### Thuulc's Domains

- [Water](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md)
- [Air](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Air.md)
- [Earth](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md)
- [Fire](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)
- [Death](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md)

### Heresy

Leaving Thuulc's faith curses you with the perfect madness of a doomed fool.

- Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Intelligence.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- You cannot benefit from [Thuulc's Boon](#Thuulc's%20Boon) until you complete a quest of the GM's choosing.

## Thuulc's Ethos

Thuulc, demon of the deep. While his chief domain is [Water](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md), he is the hoarder of all forbidden and arcane knowledge, and grants his followers abilities to glimpse the un-glimpseable.

Many a mage have been tempted by the draw of the forbidden knowledge that Thuulc offers. There is some knowledge that the [Arcane Guild](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) has banned for reason. Word to the wise; let sleeping dogs lie, lest the great beast of the deep wrap his tentacles around your mind.
