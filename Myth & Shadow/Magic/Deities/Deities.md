# Deities

A PC chooses a [Pantheon](Pantheons/Pantheons.md) as the basis for their faith. Within a Pantheon, a PC can choose a Patron Deity. These confer mechanical benefits. These benefits are determined by that Deity's associated [Domains](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md).

A Deity can have at most two domains. Additionally, a deity can only be associated with one of [The Elements](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md#The%20Elements). That being said, the GM and players can also decide they want to support a different kind of deity. Reference the [Deity Template](Deity%20Template.md) for a guide to make your own.
