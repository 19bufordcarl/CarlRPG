# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells. Arcane knowledge is fickle, complex, and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) is tiring.

A PC can memorize a number of [Spells](Spells.md) equal to 2 times the PCs [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) stat.

| Intelligence | Max number of spells memorized |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1            | 2                              |
| 2            | 4                              |
| 3            | 6                              |
| 4            | 8                              |
| 5            | 10                             |
| 6            | 12                             |
| 7            | 14                             |
| 8            | 16                             |
| 9            | 18                             |
| 10           | 20                             |
Through [Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md), PCs can 'store' spells beyond what they can memorize.
## Memorizing New Spells (Learning)
PCs do not automatically learn [Spells](Spells.md) at [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They must learn using the following methods.
### Finding Spell Scrolls
A PC can attempt to [Learn New Spells From Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Learning%20From%20Spell%20Scrolls).
### Self Study
PCs can learn [Spells](Spells.md) with [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level) when they [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

In order to learn a spell this way, the PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) that spell experimenting. Then they roll a d20. On a natural 1, they suffer two [Critical Miscast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) effects

A PC must have memorization room available to learn spells this way.
- You cannot 'forget' spells, they can only be forced out of your brain when memorizing spells.
### Arcane Study
The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) to facilitate this over [Downtime](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime).
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells](Spells.md) associated with the [Death](Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.*

If a PC does not have memory for spells left, they can still get new spells using this method by studying with a professor to [Make a Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Making%20Spell%20Scrolls) for any spells they wish to learn.
- This spell counts as being scribed by the PC.

You must first be initiated into the guild to receive its schooling. This is a riskless, albeit slow, way to learn new spells.
