# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells. Arcane knowledge is fickle, complex, and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) is tiring.

A PC can memorize a number of [Spells](Spells.md) equal to 2 times the PCs [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) stat.

| Intelligence | Max number of spells memorized |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1            | 2                              |
| 2            | 4                              |
| 3            | 6                              |
| 4            | 8                              |
| 5            | 10                             |
| 6            | 12                             |
| 7            | 14                             |
| 8            | 16                             |
| 9            | 18                             |
| 10           | 20                             |
A [Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) can provide a way for PCs to 'store' spells beyond what they can memorize.

[Spells](Spells.md) that are learned through a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) do not count against your spell memorization total. 
## Memorizing New Spells (Learning)
PCs do not automatically learn [Spells](Spells.md) at level up, they must discover the spells in world, typically through [Finding Other's Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Using%20Other's%20Spell%20Scrolls).

PCs can choose to start with [Spells](Spells.md) equal to their [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) at [Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/Character%20Creation%20Walkthrough.md) by foregoing [Armor](../Items/Equipment/Armor.md).

If a PC does not have memory for spells left, they can still learn new spells by recording them on a spell scroll.

The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) to aid in this.
### Self Study
*Optional Rule: Recommended*
PCs can learn [Spells](Spells.md) of a level less than or equal to their max spell level over the course of self studying for 1 month. This time 

In order to learn a spell this way, the PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) that spell experimenting.
