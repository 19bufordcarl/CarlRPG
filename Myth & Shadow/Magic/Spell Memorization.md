# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells, the knowledge is fickle, complex and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and casting spells can be a source of fatigue.

A PC can memorize a number of spells equal to 2 times the PCs [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) stat.

| Intelligence | Max number of spells memorized |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1            | 2                              |
| 2            | 4                              |
| 3            | 6                              |
| 4            | 8                              |
| 5            | 10                             |
| 6            | 12                             |
| 7            | 14                             |
| 8            | 16                             |
| 9            | 18                             |
| 10           | 20                             |

Spells that are learned through a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) do not count against your spell memorization total. 

## Spell Books and Scrolls - 'Memory Storage'
[Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) are created by mages using [Mythril](Mythril.md) infused ink. They are typically bound up in a spell book, but can also be loose, and can facilitate learning or casting.

A PC can scribe spells in a spell scroll or book.

In order to use a spell book this way, you must scribe the spell in [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink, which is made by putting an amount of Mythril powder equal to the casting cost of the spell into normal ink. 
- The powder diffuses unnaturally well into the ink.
	- Once in the ink, it does not take up any item slots, but cannot be used to cast spells directly anymore, only for scribing.

- A single stroke of the pen into the ink absorbs all the Mythril ink at once, the pen is the ready to scribe the spell, for the learned mage.
	- It take 6 minutes (1 delve [Round](../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to scribe 1 spell this way.
	- Hardly any of the mundane ink is actually used, the rest of the ink goes back to normal.

### Spell book memorization
During a short [Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md), you can memorize any number of spells you have scribed in spell books and scrolls. You may have to forget spells to make sure you don't exceed your memorization limit.

*This effectively lets you swap out spells with those you have scribed. Be careful not to forget any spells which you have not scribed yet, lest you have to relearn them from scratch!*
#### Interruption
If spell book memorization is [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting#Interruption), you must stop memorizing to engage in combat. If you stop this process, a random spell you were memorizing is forgotten and it's ink is destroyed.

## Memorizing New Spells (Learning)
PCs do not automatically learn spells at level up, they must discover the spells in world. 

PCs can choose to start with spells equal to their [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) at [Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/Character%20Creation%20Walkthrough.md) by foregoing [Armor](../Items/Equipment/Armor.md).

The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) to aid in this.
### Self Study
*Optional Rule: Recommended*
PCs can learn spells of a level less than or equal to their max spell level over the course of self studying for 1 month. In order to learn a spell, the PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) that spell experimenting.

If a PC does not have memory for spells left, they can still learn new spells provided they have a book to record them.
