# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells, the knowledge is fickle, complex and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and casting spells can be a source of fatigue.

A PC can memorize spells equal to 2 times the PCs Intelligence stat.

| Intelligence | Max number of spells known |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1            | 2                          |
| 2            | 4                          |
| 3            | 6                          |
| 4            | 8                          |
| 5            | 10                         |
| 6            | 12                         |
| 7            | 14                         |
| 8            | 16                         |
| 9            | 18                         |
| 10           | 20                         |

Spells that are granted by a [[Spells/Patrons/Patron\|Patron]] do not count against your spell memorization total. 

## Spell Book 'Memory Storage'
A PC can scribe spells in a spell book if they choose and can choose to replace any spell they know with any spell they have the appropriate knowledge of. 

In order to use a spell book this way, you must scribe the spell in [[Mythril]] ink, which can simply be made by putting an amount of Mythril powder equal to the casting cost of the spell into normal ink. 
- The powder diffuses unnaturally well into the ink.
	- Once in the ink, it does not take up any item slots, but cannot be used to cast spells directly anymore, only for scribing.
- A single stroke of the pen into the ink absorbs all the Mythril ink at once, the pen is the ready to scribe the spell, for the learned mage.
	- Hardly any of the mundane ink is actually used, which just goes back to normal.
- The magic of the inked spell let's a sufficiently powerful mind absorb the knowledge of the spell into their being much faster than learning it again from scratch.
- Each mind has their own way of understanding and scribing a spell. 
	- Trying to [[Spell Memorization#Memorizing New Spells (Learning)\|learn a new spell]] from a inked page you did not write requires an [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence|Intelligence]] [[../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] of [[../Game Procedures/DC|DC]] 15. 
		- On a failure, the page disintegrates and casts the spell with you as the target. 
			- Also, roll on the [[Miscast Tables/!Mythril Miscast Tables|!Mythril Miscast Tables]]
		- On a success, you learn the spell.

In this way a spell book can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to memorize.

Spells can be swapped out from memory with a spell book over any long [[../Game Procedures/Resting\|Rest]].

## Memorizing New Spells (Learning)
PCs do not automatically learn spells at level up, they must discover the spells in world. 

PCs can choose to start with spells equal to their [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] at [[../Character Creation/Character Creation Walkthrough|Character Creation]] by foregoing [[../Items/Basic Equipment/Armor|Armor]].

The default setting has spell learning through [[../Referee Specific/Economy/Detailed Prices/Relevant Prices/Arcane Guild\|Arcane Guilds]] to aid in this.

*Optional Rule: Self Study (Recommended)*
*PCs can learn spells of a level less than or equal to their max spell level over the course of self studying for 1 month. In order to learn a spell, the PC must spend 10x the amount of [[Mythril\|Mythril]] powder required to [[Spellcasting\|Cast]] that spell experimenting.*

*If a PC does not have memory left, they can still learn new spells provided they have a book to record them.*
