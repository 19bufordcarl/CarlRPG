# Spell Scrolls
[Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) are created by mages using [Mythril](Mythril.md) infused ink. They are typically bound up in a spell book, but can also be loose.

Spell scrolls can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md).
## Making Spell Scrolls
A PC can scribe [Spells](Spells.md) in a spell scroll or book.

In order to scribe a spell this way, you must scribe it in [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink. [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink is made by putting an amount of Mythril powder equal to the casting cost of the spell into normal ink. 
- The powder diffuses unnaturally well into the ink.
	- Once in the ink, the [Mythril](Mythril.md) does not take up any item slots, but cannot be used to cast spells directly anymore, only for scribing.

- A single stroke of the pen into the ink absorbs all the Mythril ink at once, the pen is the ready to scribe the spell, for the learned mage.
	- It take 6 minutes (1 delve [Round](../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to scribe 1 spell this way.
	- Hardly any of the mundane ink is actually used, the rest of the ink goes back to normal.

### Spell book memorization
During a short [Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md), you can memorize any number of spells you have scribed in spell books and scrolls. You may have to forget spells to make sure you don't exceed your memorization limit.

*This effectively lets you swap out spells with those you have scribed. Be careful not to forget any spells which you have not scribed yet, lest you have to relearn them from scratch!*
#### Interruption
If spell book memorization is [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting#Interruption), you must stop memorizing to engage in combat. If you stop this process, a random spell you were memorizing is forgotten and it's ink is destroyed.

## Using Other's Spell Scrolls
Each mind has their own way of understanding and scribing a spell. 

Trying to [learn a new spell](Spell%20Memorization#Memorizing%20New%20Spells%20(Learning)) from a inked page you did not write requires an [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) of [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 10 + (3 x the [Spell's Level](Spell%20Level.md)) and takes 1 hour. This can be done on a short [Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md).

- On a failure, the page disintegrates, roll on the [Mythril Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Mythril%20Miscast%20Tables.md).
	- If [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting#Interruption), you must stop this process to engage in combat.
	- If you stop, roll on the [Mythril Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Mythril%20Miscast%20Tables.md).
- On a success, you learn the spell, and the inked scroll remains intact.

Alternatively, you can attempt to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) a spell from a scroll directly, destroying the ink.
- Make a [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) as if you were casting that spell normally.
- If it is of a higher [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) than your [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level), make that [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) at [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
