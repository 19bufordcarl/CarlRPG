# Spell Scrolls

[Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) are created by casters using [Mythril](Mythril.md) infused ink. Casters will usually put this individual pages together in a [Spell Book](../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md), but they can be loose.

Spell scrolls can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md), and can also be used to [Cast Spells](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Casting%20Spell%20Scrolls) directly in a pinch.

## Making Spell Scrolls

A PC can scribe [Spells](Spells.md) onto a [Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md) if they have an [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) of 2 or more.

In order to scribe a spell this way, you must scribe it in [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink. [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink is made by putting an amount of Mythril powder equal to the casting cost of the spell into normal ink.

- The powder diffuses unnaturally well into the ink.
	- Once in the ink, the [Mythril](Mythril.md) can only be used for scribing.
- A single stroke of the pen into the Mythril ink absorbs all the Mythril ink at once, leaving behind mundane ink. The pen is then ready to scribe a spell.
	- It takes a full day to scribe 1 spell this way.
		- You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day.

### Spell Scroll Memorization

While [Resting](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md), you can memorize any number of spells *that **you** have scribed* in spell scrolls. These new spells force any memorized spells you do not want out of your brain to make sure you don't exceed your [Spell Memorization](Spell%20Memorization.md) limit.

*This effectively lets you swap out spells with those you have scribed. Be careful not to forget any spells which you have not scribed yet, lest you have to relearn them from scratch!*

#### Interruption

If spell scroll memorization is [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Interruption), you must stop memorizing to engage in combat. If you stop this process, a random spell you were memorizing is forgotten and it's ink is destroyed.

## Using Spell Scrolls

Each mind has their own way of understanding and scribing a spell.

### Learning From Spell Scrolls

Trying to [Memorizing New Spells](Spell%20Memorization.md#Memorizing%20New%20Spells%20(Learning)) from a scroll you did not scribe requires [A Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) and takes 1 hour *per spell*. This can be done on a [Short Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest). If the spell was scribed by a caster from a different [Spellcasting Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) than yours, you have [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on this roll.

- On a failure, the page disintegrates, roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
	- If [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Interruption), you must stop this process if you want to engage in combat.
	- If you stop, roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
- On a success, you learn the spell, and the inked scroll remains intact.
	- If you would exceed your [Spell Memorization Limit](Spell%20Memorization.md#Spell%20Memorization), you must choose a memorized spell to forget.

*All [Arcane Guild](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) scrolls are from the [Intelligence Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md). Most [Temple](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Temple%20Services.md) scrolls are from the [Wisdom Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Wisdom%20Discipline.md), but some are from the [Charisma Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Charisma%20Discipline.md). The vast majority of scrolls you will find adventuring will be from the [Intelligence Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md) as it is the most ancient, popular, and versatile discipline of spellcasting. (If the GM does not know the discipline of the scribe of a scroll, they can roll a d100: 90 or less is intelligence, 91-99 is wisdom, 100 is charisma)*

### Casting Spell Scrolls

Alternatively, you can attempt to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) a [Spell](Spells.md) from a scroll directly, bypassing the [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) need for [Memorization](Spell%20Memorization.md). Doing so destroys the ink on the scroll.

- Make [A Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) as if you were casting the spell normally.
- On a failure, the page disintegrates.
	- If the spell is higher level than your [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level), you also roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
