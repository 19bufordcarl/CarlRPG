# Mythril

Mythril is the single most important resource in the world. It is only through Mythril that magic can be channeled into the world, and almost all [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) consumes Mythril powder.

Mages are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. 500 coins worth of Mythril powder can fit into a pouch that takes up one [Item Slot](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md). 
- This creates a one-to-one slot correspondence between coins and Mythril powder
- This means they can be counted together in your coin pouch in your [Adventurer's Pack](../Items/Equipment/Adventurer's%20Pack.md).

Mythril [Coins](../Economy/Coins.md#Imperial%20Currency%20and%20Availability) are 100 coins worth of powder condensed, melted into a single coin. Powerful mages use Mythril coins to cast higher level spells without needing to lug around bags of powder.
- Only whole units of coins are consumed on a cast, no fractional coins.
