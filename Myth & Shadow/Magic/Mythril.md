# Mythril

Mythril is the single most important resource in Mithrinia. It is only through Mythril that magic can be channeled into the mortal world; all magic consumes Mythril powder.

## Mythril Resource Cost

Unless noted otherwise, a spell consumes Mythril powder according its [Spell Level](Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

| Spell Level | Price of Mythril Powder Required (in silver coins) |
| ----------: | -------------------------------------------------: |
|           1 |                                                 10 |
|           2 |                                                 25 |
|           3 |                                                100 |
|           4 |                                                250 |
|           5 |                                               1000 |

## Carrying Mythril

Casters are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. 500 coins worth of Mythril powder can fit into a pouch that takes up one [Item Slot](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).

- This creates a one-to-one slot correspondence between [Coins](../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Coins.md) and Mythril powder
- This means they can be counted together in your coin pouch in your [Adventurer's Pack](../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md).

Mythril [Coins](../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Coins.md#Imperial%20Currency%20and%20Availability) are 100 coins worth of powder condensed and melted into a single coin. Powerful casters carry Mythril coins to cast higher level spells so they don't have to lug big bags of powder. The spellcasting process disincorporates these coins back into powder for any unused amounts.
