# Spells

A spell is a discrete magical effect. When [Spellcasting](../../Spellcasting.md), a character is manipulating the very fabric of reality, and the spell text describes how exactly that manifests in game.

A spell with a range of "Touch" can affect any one creature you could make a [Melee Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) against (including the caster if desired).
