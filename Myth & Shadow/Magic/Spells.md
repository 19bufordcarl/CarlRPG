# Spells

A spell is a discrete magical effect. These effects manipulate the very fabric of reality, and the spell text describes how exactly that manifests in game. [Spellcasting](Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) outlines the mechanics for using spell magic.

Every spell has some [Spell Attributes](Spells/Spell%20Attributes.md) that determine important mechanics about it.

*(See [Spell Indices](Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Spell%20Indices.md) for a list of known spells)*

## Crafting

High level PCs can look into [Crafting Magic Items](Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md) using the spells they know.
