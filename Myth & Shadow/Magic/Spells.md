# Spells

A spell is a discrete magical effect that manipulates the very fabric of reality. A spell's text describes the game mechanics for it. [Spellcasting](Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) details the requirements to use magic.

Every spell has some [Spell Attributes](Spells/Spell%20Attributes.md) that determine important mechanics about it.

[Cantrips](Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Cantrips/{Cantrips}.md) are a special type of spell that PCs can learn.

*See [Spell Indices](Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Spell%20Indices.md) for the list of spells recorded in the Imperial Library*.

## Crafting

PCs can learn how to do [Basic Alchemy](Crafting/Basic%20Alchemy.md) with an [Alchemist Kit](../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md).

High level PCs can look into [Crafting Magic Items](Crafting/Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md) using the spells they know.
