# Old School Alchemy

Old school alchemy in the vein of classic TTRPG games is only available to high level characters and is very powerful. It fits better in a more magical or gonzo setting.

## Brewing Procedure

Brewing creates potions with no expiration date. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) *and* it's score is at least 5.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) ability score is at least 8.
2. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. 100x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) for the potion.
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
6. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. The brewing process takes one full day *per [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)* succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.
	3. You **cannot** benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) during days spent brewing.
