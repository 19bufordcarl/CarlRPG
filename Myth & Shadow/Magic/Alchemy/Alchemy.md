# Alchemy

Alchemy is the foundation of modern magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.
## Brewing Procedure
Potion brewing requires:
1. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
2. Twice the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) that [Spell](../Spells.md).
3. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
5. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. The brewing process generally takes 1 hour succeed or fail. 
	2. A failure consumes all materials still and yields bad water.
	3. Brewing can be done over a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
## Potion Rules
1. Potions retain the ranges of their [Spells](../Spells.md) as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Liquid must be drunk.
	2. Touch/Target: The liquid must be drunk or coat the target.
		1. Can be thrown as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md).
	3. AOE: Explodes in the radius when the bottle is uncorked / broken.
		1. Can be thrown as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md).
2. When the potion is drunk / opened, the [Spell](../Spells.md) takes effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../Concentration.md), the potion does not.
3. Potions benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

#### Potion FAQs
- As a general rule of thumb, effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect. 
	- Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect. 

- Thus, potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the radius incurs the full effect. 

## Harvesting Ingredients
*Optional Rule: (Not recommended)*
*A monster part from the associated domain of that spell reduces the spellcasting check required equal to the level of the monster from which the part was harvested.* 

*Monsters have a number of harvestable parts equal to their level.*

*Only one monster part can be used per potion brewed.*
