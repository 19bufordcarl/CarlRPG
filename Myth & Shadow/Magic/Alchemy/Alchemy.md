# Alchemy

Alchemy is the foundation of modern magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.

## Brewing Procedure

Potion brewing requires:

1. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
2. 100x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the potion.
3. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
5. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. The brewing process takes one full day succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.
	3. You **cannot** brew a potion and benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest).

## Potion Rules

1. Potions retain the ranges of their [Spells](../Spells.md) as follows (unless otherwise augmented).
	1. Self: Liquid must be drunk.
	2. Touch/Target: The liquid must be drunk or coat the target.
		1. Can be thrown as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md).
	3. AOE: Explodes in the prescribed AOE when the bottle is uncorked / broken.
		1. Can be thrown as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md).
	4. You can 'reduce' the potency (AOE can be Touch can be Self), but not the other way.
2. When the potion is drunk / opened, the [Spell](../Spells.md) takes effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../Concentration.md), the potion does not.
3. Potions benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

### Potion FAQs

- As a general rule of thumb, effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect.
	- Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect.
- Thus, potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the AOE incurs the full effect.

## Buying and Selling

By default, buying and selling potions is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, buy for double the creation cost and sell for half. Hard to fence, hard to get.

## Harvesting Ingredients

*Optional Rule: (Not recommended)*
The GM may add hidden rules for ingredient effects appropriate to the campaign setting.
