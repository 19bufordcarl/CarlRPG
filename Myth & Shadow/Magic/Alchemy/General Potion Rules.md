# Potion Rules

## Range

Potions use the range of the imbued [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) to determine the target(s) affected.

*Potions can be thrown as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md).*

### Self

The potion must be drunk.

### Touch or Target

The potion can either be drunk or coat the target.

### AOE

Explodes in the prescribed AOE when the potion bottle is uncorked or broken (brewer's choice).

## Action Economy

A potion can be used as an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md), causing the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) to take effect.

## Potion FAQs

- You don't need to make a [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for potions.
- If the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)))*
- If the spell requires [Concentration](../Spellcasting/Concentration.md), the potion does not.
- The spell's duration is the same as it would normally be.
- Potions benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.
- As a general rule of thumb, effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect.
	- Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect.
	- This means potions cannot be shared (unless they have an AOE range).
- You can 'reduce' the range of potion, but you cannot increase it.
	- AOE can become target or self, but not the other way around.

## Buying and Selling

By default, buying and selling potions is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, buy for double the creation cost and sell for half. Hard to fence, hard to get.

## Harvesting Ingredients

*Optional Rule: (Not recommended)*
The GM may add hidden rules for ingredient effects appropriate to the campaign setting.
