# Low Fantasy Alchemy

*Optional Rule*

Alchemy is the foundation of modern magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing. If you use [Low Fantasy Alchemy](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md), then PCs below 7th [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) are incapable of [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).

This ruleset is best for a lower magic setting along the lines of 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.

# Low Level (PCs Below 7th Level)

## Quick Brewing Procedure

Quick brewing lets players brew potions rapidly. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) ability score is at least 3.
		1. Treat it as 2 lower for Quick Brew Ability Table if it's not your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md).
2. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. The [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required for the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
6. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. Quick brew potions lose their magic at the next dawn.
	2. Quick brewing takes 1 hour, it is usually done immediately after a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
		1. You can brew potions determined by your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) during this time.
			1. See the Quick Brew Ability Table
		2. *(Optional Rule)* PCs can attempt to quick brew beyond the amount in the table for a day. This requires a [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for each additional potion.
			1. This roll is made in secret by the GM.
			2. Any potions that have a failed rolled deal 1 [Necrotic](../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage when drunk.
			3. Any [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) causes it's effect to take place as well when drunk.
	3. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.

### Quick Brew Ability Table

This table determines the number of potions that a mage can brew in a day. Depending on their [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md), they reference the relevant [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) and can brew a number of potions of the corresponding levels. Each potion costs the corresponding amount of [Mythril](../Mythril.md).
