# Low Fantasy Alchemy

Alchemy is the foundation of modern magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing. 

If you use [Low Fantasy Alchemy](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md), then PCs are incapable of [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) until they learn how to cast spells through the story (GM's discretion), or they become capable of the [True Brewing Procedure](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md#True%20Brewing%20Procedure), whichever comes first.

*This ruleset approximates the spell slot system of BX D&D*

## Quick Brewing Procedure

Quick brewing lets players brew potions rapidly. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md).
	1. *Or* the [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) associated with your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) to be at least 3.
		1. Treat it as 2 lower when determining [Potion Slots](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md#Potion%20Slots%20Table) if it's not your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md).
2. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. The [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required for the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
6. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. Quick brew potions lose their magic at the next dawn.
		1. Or after 20 hours (5 [Watches](../../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md)) if the precise time is required.
	2. Quick brewing takes 1 hour, it can be done as part of a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest) at the very end of it.
		1. You can brew potions determined by your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) during this time.
			1. See the [Potion Slots Table](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md#Potion%20Slots%20Table).
		2. You can only do a quick brewing procedure once per [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
	3. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.

### Potion Slots Table

This table determines the number of potions that a PC can brew in a day. The PC references the [Ability Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) for their [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) to determine the number and levels of potions that they can brew. Each potion costs the corresponding amount of [Mythril](../Mythril.md).

| Ability Score | 1st Level | 2nd Level | 3rd Level | 4th Level | 5th Level | Total Mythril |
| ------------: | --------: | --------: | --------: | --------: | --------: | ------------: |
|             1 |         2 |           |           |           |           |            20 |

|             6 |         3 |         3 |         3 |           |           |           400 |
|             7 |         4 |         3 |         3 |         2 |           |           900 |
|             8 |         4 |         4 |         3 |         3 |           |          1200 |
|             9 |         4 |         4 |         4 |         3 |         1 |          2300 |
|            10 |         4 |         4 |         4 |         4 |         2 |          3500 |
