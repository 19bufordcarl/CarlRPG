# Low Fantasy Alchemy

Alchemy is the foundation of modern magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.

If you use [Low Fantasy Alchemy](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md), then PCs are incapable of [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) until they learn how to cast spells through the story (GM's discretion), or they become capable of the [True Brewing Procedure](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md#True%20Brewing%20Procedure), whichever comes first.

You can only brew potions using [Spells](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that you have [Memorized](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Memorization.md).

*This ruleset approximates the spell slot system of BX D&D*

## Quick Brewing Procedure

Quick brewing lets players brew potions rapidly. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Alchemy Ability](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md#Alchemy%20Ability).
2. Sterile containers, usually [Glass Vials](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. The [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required for all the [Spells](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) you are brewing into potions.
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. You can brew a number of potions as determined by the [Alchemy Ability](Low%20Fantasy%20Alchemy.md#Alchemy%20Ability).
	1. Quick brew potions lose their magic at the next dawn.
		1. Or after 20 hours (5 [Watches](../../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md)) if the precise time is required.
	2. Quick brewing takes 1 hour, it can be done at the end of a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
		1. You can only do one quick brewing procedure per [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

### Alchemy Ability

A PC's Alchemy Ability determines the number of potions they can brew in a day. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). Each potion costs the corresponding amount of [Mythril](../Mythril.md).

*These are referred to as potion slots, given their similarity to spell slots of BX D&D.*

## True Brewing Procedure

True brewing creates potions with no expiration date. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) *and* it's score is at least 7.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) is at least 10.
2. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. 100x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) for the potion.
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
6. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. The brewing process takes one full day *per [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)* succeed or fail.
		1. You can do no other meaningful activities that day.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.
	3. You **cannot** benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) during days spent brewing.
