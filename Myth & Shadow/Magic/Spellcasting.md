# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder or magic items.

## Spellcasting Roll
To successfully cast the spell, you must make an [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) for that spell.
	The [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) is equal to 10 + 2 x the [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md). 
## Spellcasting Material Cost
Casting spells uses an amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder correspond to the [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md).
- You can only cast spells you have [Memorized](Spell%20Memorization.md).
- Casting spells learned from a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) uses the [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) associated with that [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md).
- Casting from magic items uses whatever the rules of that magic item are. 
	- By default, [Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) and magic items are treated the same as [Mythril](Mythril.md) casting.

On a failed check, the spell fizzles, any Mythril powder or other resource is still consumed.

On a critically failed check, a [Critical Miscast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
## Blood Magic
If you fail a spell casting check, you may choose to succeed it instead. 
	To do this, you sacrifice [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to the difference between your spellcasting roll and the spell's [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md). If this reduces your FP to 0, you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition, and then take any of the remaining difference as damage to your [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).
## Spellcasting Aesthetics
Spellcasting requires ***two free hands*** for complex hand movements. You must speak an otherworldly incantation whose sound booms with arcane energy unless otherwise noted. Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under “Casting”. (Ex. [Alarm](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%201/Alarm.md))

Spellcasting that shoots projectiles at a a target do not require a separate [Ranged Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) that is part of what the spellcasting check is doing. [Line of Sight and Cover Rules](../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md#Line%20of%20Sight%20and%20Cover%20Rules) apply to ranged spells.

Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md).
