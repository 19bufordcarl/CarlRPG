# Enchantment Rules

See [Enchanting](Enchanting.md) for the creation procedure.

## Charged Enchantments

### Using Charges

1. A charge can be used as an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md), causing the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) to take effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../Spellcasting/Concentration.md), the charge does too.
2. Enchantments can benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

### Recharging

Charges do **NOT** replenish automatically. You must imbue the item with the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required again. However, since the magic is already bound to the item, you do not need to make another [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), nor do you need access to arcane equipment. Recharging takes 1 hour of uninterrupted focus per charge replenished.

## Passive Enchantments

### Using Passives

1. Passive enchantment [Spells](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) are subject to the following restrictions and modifications.
	1. Prerequisite: You can only passively enchant spells with a duration that is not "None".
	2. Target: You must be capable of targeting a humanoid with the spell.
	3. Range: The spell's range is ignored, it simply applies the [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) to the wielder at all times.
		1. No [Concentration](../Spellcasting/Concentration.md) is required for the passive enchantment.
2. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Buying and Selling

By default, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, buy for double the creation cost and sell for half. Hard to fence, hard to get.
