# Enchanting
Enchanting is the process by which magical effects are infused into items. 

Also known as creating a magic item.
## Enchanting Charges
You can enchant [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) items with [Spells](../Spells.md), and grant it a *charge* of that spell. You can spend a charge on [Weapons](../../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) as part of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md). Only items that are either [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) can be enchanted.
### Creation Procedure
Charge Enchanting requires:
1. A [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	2. [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
2. 200x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchant.
3. Access to an [Alchemist Apparatus](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Apparatus.md) or similar arcane equipment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have successfully enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process generally takes a full day succeed or fail. 
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.
	3. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day, only a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
### Charge Rules
#### Replenishing Charges
Charges do **NOT** replenish automatically. You must imbue the weapon with the Mythril required again! However, since the magic is already bound to the item, you do not need to make another spellcasting check, nor do you need access to arcane equipment. You can do this r 
#### Other Rules
1. Enchantment [Spells](../Spells.md) range becomes as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Charge use applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the wielder.
	2. Touch/Target: Charge use applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the target of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).
	3. AOE: Charge use applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the same AOE, centered on the target of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).
2. When a charge is used, the [Spell](../Spells.md) takes effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../Concentration.md), the enchantment does not.
3. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Enchanting Passives
You can enchant [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) items with [Spells](../Spells.md) that have a [Spell Range](../Spellcasting.md#Spell%20Range) of self *and* not 'None' [Duration](../Spellcasting.md#Duration), to make that [Spell](../Spells.md) active as long as the wielder is holding / wearing the enchanted item.
### Creation Procedure
Passive Enchanting requires:
1. A [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	2. [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
2. 1000x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchant.
3. Access to an [Alchemist Apparatus](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Apparatus.md) or similar arcane equipment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have successfully enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process generally takes a full day succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.
	3. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day, only a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
### Passive Rules
1. Enchantment [Spells](../Spells.md) range becomes as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the wielder at all times, no [Concentration](../Concentration.md) required.
	2. Touch/Target: Cannot be enchanted this way.
	3. AOE: Cannot be enchanted this way.
2. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.
## Buying and Selling
By default, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The referee ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, buy for double the creation cost and sell for half. Hard to fence, hard to get.
