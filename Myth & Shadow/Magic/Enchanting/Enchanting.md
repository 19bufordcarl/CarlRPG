Enchanting is the process by which magical effects are infused into items.

# Low Level (Below 5th)

## Enchanting Charges

You can enchant [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) items with [Spells](../Spells.md), and grant it a *charge* of that spell. You can spend a charge on that item as an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) to cast the stored spell. Only items that are either [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) can be enchanted.

### Using Charges

1. A charge can be used as an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md), causing the [Spell](../Spells.md) to take effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../Concentration.md), the enchantment does not.
2. Enchantments can benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Quick Charging Procedure

Quick charging lets players enchant items rapidly. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) ability score is at least 3.
2. A [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	1. [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. 20x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchantment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have enchanted the magic item!
	1. Quick charge enchantments lose their magic at the next dawn.
	2. Quick charging takes 1 hour, it is usually done immediately after a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
		1. You can do one quick charge enchantment during this time.
		2. Your second attempt to quick charge in a day has [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
			1. Subsequent attempts have the [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) stack.
				1. *The second one is 2d20 keep lowest, third is 3d20, fourth is 4d20, etc.*
			2. A [Quick Brew](../Alchemy/Alchemy.md#Quick%20Brewing%20Procedure) counts as one of these procedures too.
	3. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.

# High Level (5th and up)

## True Charging Procedure

True charging creates charge enchantments with no expiration date. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) *and* it's score is at least 5.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) ability score is at least 8.
2. A [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	1. [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. 200x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchantment.
4. Access to an [Alchemist Apparatus](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Apparatus.md) or similar arcane equipment.
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
6. On a success, you have enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process takes one week *per [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)* succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.
	3. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) those days.

### Replenishing True Charges

True charges do **NOT** replenish automatically. You must imbue the weapon with 1/2 the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required again (100x the Mythril for the spell). However, since the magic is already bound to the item, you do not need to make another [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), nor do you need access to arcane equipment. You can do this recharging over the course of 1 hour.

## Enchanting Passives

You can enchant [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) items with [Spells](../Spells.md) that have a [Spell Range](../Spellcasting.md#Spell%20Range) of self *and* not 'None' [Duration](../Spellcasting.md#Duration), to make that [Spell](../Spells.md) active as long as the wielder is holding / wearing the enchanted item.

### Creation Procedure

Passive Enchanting requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) *and* it's score is at least 7.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) ability score is at least 10.
2. A [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	1. [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. 10,000x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchantment.
4. Access to an [Alchemist Apparatus](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Apparatus.md) or similar arcane equipment.
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
6. On a success, you have successfully enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process generally takes a month per spell level succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.
	3. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) those days.

### Passive Rules

1. Enchantment [Spells](../Spells.md) are subject to the following restrictions and modifications.
	1. Prerequisite: You can only passively enchant spells with a duration that is not "None".
	2. Target: You must be capable of targeting a humanoid with the spell.
	3. Range: The spell's range is ignored, it simply applies the [Spell](../Spells.md) to the wielder at all times.
		1. No [Concentration](../Concentration.md) is required for the passive enchantment.
2. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Alternative Effects

Players may wish to create a magic item that does not model a spell exactly. Perhaps it is inspired by a spell but stronger, or perhaps they want to make a more specialized version with some drawback or curse to reduce the cost of the enchantment. Between the player and the GM, decide which category the alternative effect falls into, and apply the following [Mythril](../Mythril.md) modifier.

| Alternative Effect            | Mythril Cost Modification |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Debilitating drawback / curse |                 - (3d20)% |
| Frustrating drawback          |                 - (2d20)% |
| Annoying drawback             |                 - (1d20)% |
| Roughly equivalent            |          +/- (1d20 - 10)% |
| Minor improvement             |                 + (2d20)% |
| Major improvement             |                + (1d100)% |
| Insane improvement            |              Not possible |

## Buying and Selling

By default, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, buy for double the creation cost and sell for half. Hard to fence, hard to get.
