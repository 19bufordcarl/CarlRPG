# Enchanting
Enchanting is the process by which magical effects are infused into items. 

Also known as creating a magic item.
## Enchanting Charges
You can enchant a [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) items with [Spells](../Spells.md), and grant it a *charge* of that spell. Charges replenish on that magic item once per day at either dawn or dusk, you specify. You can spend a charge on [Weapons](../../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) as part of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md). Only items that are either [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) can be enchanted.
### Creation Procedure
Charge Enchanting requires:
1. A [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	2. [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
2. 100x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchant.
	1. Multiply this amount by 5 per additional charge you wish to add.
3. Access to an [Alchemist Apparatus](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Apparatus.md) or similar arcane equipment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have successfully enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process generally takes a full day succeed or fail. 
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.
	3. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day, only a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
### Charge Rules
1. Enchantment [Spells](../Spells.md) range becomes as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Charge use applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the wielder.
	2. Touch/Target: Charge use applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the target of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).
	3. AOE: Charge use applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the same AOE, centered on the target of an [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).
2. When a charge is used, the [Spell](../Spells.md) takes effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../Concentration.md), the enchantment does not.
3. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Enchanting Passives
You can enchant [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) items with [Spells](../Spells.md) that have a [Spell Range](../Spellcasting.md#Spell%20Range) of self *and* not 'None' [Duration](../Spellcasting.md#Duration), to make that [Spell](../Spells.md) active as long as the wielder is holding / wearing the enchanted item.
### Creation Procedure
Passive Enchanting requires:
1. A [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item.
	2. [Silvered](../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
2. 1000x the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../Spells.md) for the enchant.
3. Access to an [Alchemist Apparatus](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Apparatus.md) or similar arcane equipment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have successfully enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process generally takes a full day succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.
	3. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day, only a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
### Passive Rules
1. Enchantment [Spells](../Spells.md) range becomes as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Applies [Spell](../Spells.md) to the wielder at all times, no [Concentration](../Concentration.md) required.
	2. Touch/Target: Cannot be enchanted this way.
	3. AOE: Cannot be enchanted this way.
2. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.
