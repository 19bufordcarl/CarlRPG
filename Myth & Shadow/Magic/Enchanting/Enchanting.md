# Enchanting Procedures

Enchanting is a pillar of modern magical understanding. There are two main types of enchanting procedure, and both require a high level PC capable of wielding magic to properly complete.

## Alternative Effects

Players may wish to create a magic item that does not model a spell exactly. Perhaps it is inspired by a spell but stronger, or perhaps they want to make a more specialized version with some drawback or curse to reduce the cost of the enchantment. Between the player and the GM, decide which category the alternative effect falls into, and apply the following [Mythril](../Mythril.md) modifier.

| Alternative Effect            | Mythril Cost Modification |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Debilitating drawback / curse |                 - (3d20)% |
| Frustrating drawback          |                 - (2d20)% |
| Annoying drawback             |                 - (1d20)% |
| Roughly equivalent            |          +/- (1d20 - 10)% |
| Minor improvement             |                 + (2d20)% |
| Major improvement             |                + (1d100)% |
| Insane improvement            |              Not possible |
