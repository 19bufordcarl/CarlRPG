# Magic Apprenticeships

The main way a PC can access spell tutors is to be a member of an appropriate guild and spend the appropriate guild dues for learning a spell of the given level.

## Arcane Study

The [Arcane Guild](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) of the Mithrinian Empire takes apprentices.

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild only teaches spells to initiated members in good standing.*

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher, except to those with a letter of recommendation from a Chapter's Archmage.*

## Temple Study

The [Holy Temples](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md) across Mithrinia take acolytes.

- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may only teach spells to initiated members in good standing.*

Temples only teach [Spells](Spells.md) that have a [Domain](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md) associated with their [Deity](../Deities/Deities.md).
