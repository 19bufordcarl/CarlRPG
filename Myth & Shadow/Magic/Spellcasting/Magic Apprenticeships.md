# Magic Apprenticeships

The main way a PC can access spell tutors is to be a member of an appropriate guild and spend the appropriate guild dues for learning a spell of the given level (see below).

## Arcane Study

The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md).

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild only teaches spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells](Spells.md) associated with the [Death](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher, except to those with a letter of recommendation from a Chapter's Archmage.*

## Temple Study

The default setting also has spell learning through [Holy Temples](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md).

- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may only teach spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, 'Temples' whose Deity is associated with the [Death](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain are unlawful.*
- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher.*

Temples only teach [Spells](Spells.md) that have a [Domain](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md) associated with their [Deity](../Deities/Deities.md).
