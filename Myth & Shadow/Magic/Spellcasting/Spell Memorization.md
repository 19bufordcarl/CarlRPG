# Spell Memorization

A PC can memorize [Spells](Spells.md) that are less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Learning Spells

PCs do not automatically learn [Spells](Spells.md) at [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They must learn using the following methods.

### Self Study

A PC can self study [Spells](Spells.md) when they [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) if they increased their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).

A PC can self study 1 spell per [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), or 2 if their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) is their [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md).

In order to learn a spell this way, a PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](../Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) said spell doing experiments. Then they roll a d20. On a natural 1, they suffer two [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) effects, and they fail to learn the spell.

### Study Spell Scrolls

A PC can [Learn Spells From Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Learning%20Spells%20From%20Spell%20Scrolls) at any time.

### Apprentice Study

A PC can study [Spells](Spells.md) when they [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) if they increased their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and have access to a tutor who knows that spell.

A PC can be taught 1 spell per [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), or 2 if their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) is their [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md).

The main way a PC can access such tutors is to be a member of an appropriate guild and spend the appropriate guild dues for learning a spell of the given level (see below).

*This is a riskless, albeit resource intensive, way to learn new spells.*

#### Arcane Study

The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md).

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild only teaches spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells](Spells.md) associated with the [Death](../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher, except to those with a letter of recommendation from a Chapter's Archmage.*

#### Temple Study

The default setting also has spell learning through [Holy Temples](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md).

- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may only teach spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, 'Temples' whose Deity is associated with the [Death](../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain are unlawful.*
- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher.*

Temples only teach [Spells](Spells.md) that have a [Domain](../Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md) associated with their [Deity](../Deities/Deities.md).
