# Spell Memorization

A PC can memorize [Spells](Spells.md) that are less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

Through [Spell Scrolls](Spellcasting/Spell%20Scrolls.md), PCs can "store" spells beyond what they can memorize.

## Memorizing New Spells (Learning)

PCs do not automatically learn [Spells](Spells.md) at [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They must learn using the following methods.

### Self Study

PCs can self study [Spells](Spells.md) of a legal [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) when they [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

In order to learn a spell this way, a PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](../Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) that spell experimenting. Then they roll a d20. On a natural 1, they suffer two [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) effects, and they fail to learn the spell.

A PC can self study at most 2 spells per [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

### Finding Spell Scrolls

A PC can attempt to [Learn New Spells From Spell Scrolls](Spellcasting/Spell%20Scrolls.md#Learning%20From%20Spell%20Scrolls).

### Apprentice Study

PCs can study [Spells](Spells.md) of a legal [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) when they [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) under the direction of a tutor.

In order to learn a spell this way, a PC must be a member of an appropriate guild and spend the appropriate guild dues for learning a spell of the given level (see below). A PC can be taught at most 2 spells per [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). No rolls are required.

This is a riskless, albeit limited, way to learn new spells.

#### Arcane Study

The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md).

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild only teaches spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells](Spells.md) associated with the [Death](Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher, except to those with a letter of recommendation from a Chapter's Archmage.*

#### Temple Study

The default setting also has spell learning through [Holy Temples](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md).

- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may only teach spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, 'Temples' whose Deity is associated with the [Death](Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain are unlawful.*
- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher.*

Temples only teach [Spells](Spells.md) that have a [Domain](Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md) associated with their [Deity](../Deities/Deities.md).
