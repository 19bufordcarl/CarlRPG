# Spell Memorization

A PC can memorize [Spells](Spells.md) of a level less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Learning Spells

PCs do not automatically learn [Spells](Spells.md) at [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They must learn them through study.

A PC can learn a number of spells according to the [Spell Learning Table](Spell%20Memorization.md#Spell%20Learning%20Table).

### Self Study

A PC can self study [Spells](Spells.md) during [Downtime](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime).

- *You do not need to [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up) to learn spells*

In order to learn a spell this way, a PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](../Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) said spell doing experiments. The PC then rolls a d20. On a natural 1, they suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) and fail to learn the spell.

### Apprentice Study

A PC can study [Spells](Spells.md) during [Downtime](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by engaging in [Magic Apprenticeships](Magic%20Apprenticeships.md), or if they have a [Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md).

*This is a riskless way to learn new spells.*

## Spell Learning Table

A PC can learn spells based on their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) in accordance with their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md). They can learn more spells if it is also their [Favored Ability](../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md).
