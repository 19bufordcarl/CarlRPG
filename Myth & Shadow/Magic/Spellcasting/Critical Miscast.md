# Critical Miscast

If you do not have enough [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) remaining for the [Magicka Point Cost](Magicka%20Point%20Cost.md) during [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md), you miscast the spell.

The spell backfires in some unexpected, usually bad, way. Roll on the [Miscast Table](../Spells/Miscast%20Tables/Miscast%20Table.md).
