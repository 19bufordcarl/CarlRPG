# Spells

A spell is a discrete magical effect. These effects manipulate the very fabric of reality, and the spell text describes how exactly that manifests in game.

## Spell Levels

A [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) is its 'power level'. (See [Spell Indices](../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Spell%20Indices.md) for a list).

## Spell Memorization

A PC can [Memorize Spells](Spell%20Memorization.md) of an appropriate spell level.

## Spell Casting

A PC can use a [Spellcasting Procedure](Spellcasting%20Procedures/Spellcasting%20Procedures.md) to cause a spell to take effect.

## Crafting

[Alchemy](../Crafting/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) and [Enchanting](../Crafting/Enchanting/Enchanting.md) allows high level PCs to make their own magic items.
