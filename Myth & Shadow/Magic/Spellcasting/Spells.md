# Spells

A spell is a discrete magical effect. These effects manipulate the very fabric of reality, and the spell text describes how exactly that manifests in game.

## Spell Levels

A [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) is the 'power level' of the spell. (See spell [Spell Indices](../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Spell%20Indices.md) for a list).

## Spell Memorization

A PC can [Memorize Spells](Spell%20Memorization.md) of an appropriate spell level.

## Spell Casting

A PC can [Cast](Spellcasting.md) spells they have memorized, using [Mythril](../Mythril.md) powder as a resource.

## Alchemy

[Alchemy](../Crafting/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) can imbue spells into liquid form, making potions.

## Enchanting

[Enchanting](../Crafting/Enchanting/Enchanting.md) can imbue spells into scrolls, making spell scrolls.
