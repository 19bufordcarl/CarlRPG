# Spellcasting Ability

A PC's *Spellcasting Ability* determines how they cast a spell. It is used for a variety of things, chiefly [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), [Max Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level), and [Spell Memorization](../Spell%20Memorization.md).

A character's *Spellcasting Ability* is determined by their [Spellcasting Discipline](Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md).
