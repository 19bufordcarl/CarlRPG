# The Intelligence Discipline

The [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) discipline channels [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) through memory and knowledge.

## Domains

You can only memorize [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of your learned [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md).

You can learn a new *Intelligence Domain* when:

1. You first learn the *Intelligence Discipline*
2. Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes 2 for the first time.
3. Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes 4 for the first time.
4. Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes 8 for the first time.

## Spellcasting

For [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of your *Intelligence Domains*, you may use [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) as your [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting%20Ability.md).

## Spell Learning

The number of [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) spells you may have [Memorized](../Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) is determined as follows.

| INT | Total INT Spells | Increase |
| --: | ---------------: | -------: |
|   1 |                1 |        1 |
|   2 |                2 |        1 |
|   3 |                4 |        2 |
|   4 |                6 |        2 |
|   5 |                8 |        2 |
|   6 |               10 |        2 |
|   7 |               12 |        2 |
|   8 |               14 |        2 |
|   9 |               17 |        3 |
|  10 |               20 |        3 |

*If [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), increase your total spells known by one.*
