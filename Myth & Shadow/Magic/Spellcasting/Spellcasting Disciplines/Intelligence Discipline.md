# The Intelligence Discipline

The [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) discipline channels [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) through memory and knowledge.

## Domains

You can only memorize [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your learned [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md).

You can learn a new *Domain* when:

1. You first learn the *Intelligence Discipline*
2. Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes 2 for the first time.
3. Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes 4 for the first time.
4. Your [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) becomes 8 for the first time.

## Spellcasting

For [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your *Domains*, you use [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) as your [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
