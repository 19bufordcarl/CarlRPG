# Disciplines

A discipline represent alternative ways that a character can wield the forces of magic.

A PC can choose a discipline at [New Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md). A PC can only have one spellcasting discipline at a time.

A PC can change their discipline or learn a new discipline over [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md) or [Arcane Guild](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) that follows a different discipline. This can only be done when the PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), and they will need to pay for initiation & training (500 coins).
