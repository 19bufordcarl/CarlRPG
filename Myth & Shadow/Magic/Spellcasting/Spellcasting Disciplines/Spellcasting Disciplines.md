# Disciplines

A discipline is a study of a mental force that a character can use to wield magic.

## The Spellcasting Disciplines

### Intelligence

The [Intelligence Discipline](Intelligence%20Discipline.md) lets the PC use [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) for [Spells](../Spells.md).
*The [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) of the Mithrinian Empire follows this discipline*

### Wisdom

The [Wisdom Discipline](Wisdom%20Discipline.md) lets the PC use [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) for [Spells](../Spells.md).
*Most [Temples](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md) in Mithrinia follow this discipline*

## Charisma

## Learning New Disciplines

PCs can choose a discipline at [New Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md).

A PC can change their discipline or learn a new discipline over [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md) or [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) that follows a different discipline. This can only be done when the PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), and they will need to pay for initiation & training (500 coins).
