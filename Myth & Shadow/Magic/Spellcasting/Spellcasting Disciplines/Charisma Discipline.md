# The Charisma Discipline

The [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) discipline channels [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) through spiritual connection.

## Domains

You can only memorize [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your learned [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md).

You can learn a new *Charisma Domain* when:

1. You first learn the *Charisma Discipline*
2. Your [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) becomes 10 for the first time.

## Spellcasting

For [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your *Charisma Domains*, you may use [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) as your [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
