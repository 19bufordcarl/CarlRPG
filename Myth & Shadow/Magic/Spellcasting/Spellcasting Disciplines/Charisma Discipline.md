# The Charisma Discipline

The [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) discipline channels [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) through spiritual connection.

## Domains

You can only memorize [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of your learned [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md).

You can learn a new *Charisma Domain* when:

1. You first learn the *Charisma Discipline*
2. Your [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) becomes 10 for the first time.

## Spellcasting

For [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of your *Charisma Domains*, you may use [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) as your [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting%20Ability.md).

## Spell Learning

The number of [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) spells you may have [Memorized](../Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) is determined as follows.

| CHA | Total CHA Spells | Increase |
| --: | ---------------: | -------: |
|   1 |                1 |        1 |
|   2 |                2 |        1 |
|   3 |                3 |        1 |
|   4 |                4 |        1 |
|   5 |                5 |        1 |
|   6 |                6 |        1 |
|   7 |                7 |        1 |
|   8 |                8 |        1 |
|   9 |                9 |        1 |
|  10 |               10 |        1 |

*If [Charisma](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), increase your total spells known by one.*
