# Disciplines

A discipline is a study of a mental force that a character can use to wield magic.

## The Spellcasting Disciplines

- The [Intelligence Discipline](Intelligence%20Discipline.md)
- The [Wisdom Discipline](Wisdom%20Discipline.md)
- The [Charisma Discipline](Charisma%20Discipline.md)

## Learning New Disciplines

PCs that choose ***Caster*** can learn one *Discipline* at [New Player Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md).

A PC can learn a new *Discipline* over [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md) or [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) that follows that new *Discipline*. This can be done when the PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They will need to pay for initiation and training (500 coins), and they need to have the relevant [Ability Score](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) be at least 3.

## Multiple Disciplines

If a PC has multiple disciplines, they use the relevant discipline's [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting%20Ability.md) for rules related to [Spells](../../Spells.md) of the chosen [Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) for that discipline.

*Ex. A PC knows Water through Wisdom and Fire through Charisma. They are level 7, have 8 wisdom and 4 charisma. Their max spell level for spells from the water domain is 4th level, but for the fire domain it is only 2nd level. They use wisdom for casting water spells and charisma for casting fire spells. If a spell has both domains, they may choose which one to use.*
