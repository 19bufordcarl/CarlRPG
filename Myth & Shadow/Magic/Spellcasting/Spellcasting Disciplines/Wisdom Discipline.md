# The Wisdom Discipline

The [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) discipline channels [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) through willpower and intuition.

## Domains

You can only memorize [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your learned [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md).

You can learn a new *Wisdom Domain* when:

1. You first learn the *Wisdom Discipline*
2. Your [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) becomes 5 for the first time.

## Spellcasting

For [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your *Wisdom Domains*, you may use [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) as your [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
