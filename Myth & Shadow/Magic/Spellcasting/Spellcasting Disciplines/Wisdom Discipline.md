# The Wisdom Discipline

The [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) discipline channels [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) through willpower and intuition.

## Domains

You can only memorize [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your learned [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md).

You can learn a new *Wisdom Domain* when:

1. You first learn the *Wisdom Discipline*
2. Your [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) becomes 5 for the first time.

## Spellcasting

For [Spells](../Spells.md) that share one of your *Wisdom Domains*, you may use [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) as your [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md).

## Spell Learning

The number of [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) spells you may have [Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md) is determined as follows.

| WIS | Total WIS Spells | Increase |
| --: | ---------------: | -------: |
|   1 |                1 |        1 |
|   2 |                2 |        1 |
|   3 |                3 |        1 |
|   4 |                4 |        1 |
|   5 |                5 |        1 |
|   6 |                7 |        2 |
|   7 |                9 |        2 |
|   8 |               11 |        2 |
|   9 |               13 |        2 |
|  10 |               15 |        2 |

*If [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) is your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md), increase the total by one.*
