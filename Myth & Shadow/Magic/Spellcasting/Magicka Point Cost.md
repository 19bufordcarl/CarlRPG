# Magicka Point Cost

Consuming [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder for [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) also requires you consume [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md).

The amount of magicka consumed depends on the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md). If you do not have enough current [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) for the consumption roll, you consume all your current [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md), and you fail at [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md).

| Spell Level | Magicka Points Consumed |
| ----------: | ----------------------: |
| Cantrip (0) |          Restore Xd6 MP |
|           1 |                    1d12 |
|           2 |                    1d20 |
|           3 |                    2d20 |
|           4 |                    3d20 |
|           5 |                   1d100 |
|      Mythic |                   2d100 |

*Notably, casting [Cantrips](../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Cantrips/{Cantrips}.md) actually restores Magicka.*

*This is due to the familiarity the caster has with their cantrips. Casting them actually serves as a way for the caster to refocus their arcana to the firmament and rechanges their arcane energy.*
