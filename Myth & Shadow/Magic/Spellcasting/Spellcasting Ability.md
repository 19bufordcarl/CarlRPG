# Spellcasting Ability

A Spell's *Spellcasting Ability* determines how the spell is cast. It is used for a variety of things, chiefly [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level), and [Spell Memorization](Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md).

A Spell's *Spellcasting Ability* is determined by the [Spellcasting Discipline](Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) that the PC used to learn the spell.
