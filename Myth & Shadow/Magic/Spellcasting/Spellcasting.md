# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle and ancient. Not even the best mages know its true nature. Hence why it is called magic. Mortals need [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder to cast [Spells](../Spells.md).

## Spellcasting Requirements

To attempt to cast a [Spell](../Spells.md):

1. You must have two free hands and the ability to speak a booming incantation.
2. It must be one of your [Known Spells](Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md).
3. You must use the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder specified for the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

## The Spellcasting Roll

To cast a [Spell](../Spells.md), make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md), where XX is 10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)).

On a successful [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>The spell takes effect. On a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md), a [Critical Cast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Cast.md) occurs.

On a failed [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md):

>On a **failure**, the spell fizzles and burns you.You take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).
>On a [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md), a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
