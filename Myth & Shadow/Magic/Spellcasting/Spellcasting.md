# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. [Spells](../Spells.md) cast by mortals consumes [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder.

## Spellcasting Requirements

To attempt to cast a [Spell](../Spells.md):

1. You must have two free hands and the ability to speak a booming incantation.
2. It must be one of your [Known Spells](Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md).
3. You must use the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder specified for the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

## The Spellcasting Roll

To cast a [Spell](../Spells.md), you make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) using your [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md):

- The [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is equal to 10 + (2 x the [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)).
- On a success, the spell takes effect.
	- On a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md), a [Critical Cast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Cast.md) occurs.
- On a failure, the spell fizzles and you take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).
	- On a [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md), a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.

## Forceful Spellburn

If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you may choose to succeed it â€” as long as it wasn't [Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).

If you do this, you take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the difference between the result and the [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md). If this damage reduces your [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) to 0, you [Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md#Dead). After taking this damage, you become [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md).
