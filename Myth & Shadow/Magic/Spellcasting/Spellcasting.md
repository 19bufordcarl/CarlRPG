# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. [Spells](../Spells.md) are channeled using a [Magical Focus](Magical%20Focus.md) that consumes [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder.

## The Spellcasting Roll

To successfully cast a [Spell](../Spells.md):

1. You must be wielding a [Magical Focus](Magical%20Focus.md) for this spell.
2. You must use the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder for the [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).
3. You must speak a booming magical incantation.
4. You make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) using [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md) of the [Magical Focus](Magical%20Focus.md).
	1. The [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is equal to 10 + (2 x the [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)).
	2. On a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) a [Critical Cast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Cast.md) occurs.
5. If you fail the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md):
	1. The spell 'fizzles' and the magic does not take root.
	2. You take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) (*Spellburn*).
	3. On a [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md), a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.

## Casting Time

Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under *Casting*.
*(Ex. [Alarm](../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Alarm.md) takes 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md))

### Slow Casting

Spells with a casting time of "1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md)" take a [Slow Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action).

## Duration

All [Spells](../Spells.md) have a specified duration. The spell's effect lasts *for the duration*.

A [Spell](../Spells.md) with a duration of "None" simply applies their effect once and then ends.

Some [Spells](../Spells.md) require [Concentration](../Spells/Concentration.md) for their duration to continue.

## Spell Range

[Spells](../Spells.md) that shoot projectiles at a target do not require a separate [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md), it is part of [The Spellcasting Roll](#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll). You must be able to clearly see the target of your spell.

Touch spells can only be cast on creatures whom you could make a [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) against.

[Spells](../Spells.md) with an [{AOE} Area of Effect](../Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/{AOE}%20Area%20of%20Effect.md) apply relevant spell text to all affected creatures.

## Upcast

If you want to make a spell more powerful, you can use an amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to cast a higher [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md), and gain the upcast benefits listed in the spell text. The [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) is treated as whatever you upcasted it to for the purposes of [The Spellcasting Roll](#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).

The level at which you upcast a spell cannot exceed your [Maximum Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Forceful Spellburn

If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you may choose to succeed it (as long as it wasn't [Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md)).

If you do this, you take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the difference between the result and the [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md). If this damage reduces your [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) to 0, you [Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md#Dead). After taking this damage, you become [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md).
