# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. [Spells](../Spells.md) cast by mortals consumes [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder.

## Spellcasting Requirements

To successfully cast a [Spell](../Spells.md):

1. You must have two free hands and the ability to speak a booming incantation.
2. You must have the [Spell Memorized](Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) with one of the [{Spellcasting Disciplines}](Spellcasting%20Disciplines/{Spellcasting%20Disciplines}.md).
3. You must use the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder specified for the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

## The Spellcasting Roll

To cast a [Spell](../Spells.md), you make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) using the [Spellcasting Ability](Spellcasting%20Ability.md) with the following rules:

- The [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is equal to 10 + (2 x the [Spell's Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)).
- On a success, the spell takes effect.
	- On a [Critical Success](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md), a [Critical Cast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Cast.md) occurs.
- On a failure, the spell fizzles and you take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).
	- On a [Critical Failure](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md), a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
 
## Casting Time

Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under *Casting*.
*(Ex. [Alarm](../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Alarm.md) takes 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md))

### Slow Casting

Spells with a casting time of "1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md)" take a [Slow Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to cast.

## Duration

All [Spells](../Spells.md) have a specified duration. The spell's effect lasts *for the duration*.

A [Spell](../Spells.md) with a duration of "None" simply apply their effect once and then end.

Some [Spells](../Spells.md) require [Concentration](../Spells/Concentration.md) for their duration to continue.

## Spell Range

You must be able to clearly see the target of your spell and they must be in range.

Touch spells can only be cast on creatures whom you could make a [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) against.

[Spells](../Spells.md) with an [{AOE} Area of Effect](../Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/{AOE}%20Area%20of%20Effect.md) apply relevant spell text to all affected creatures.

*Note: [Spells](../Spells.md) that shoot projectiles at a target do not make a [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md).*

## Upcast

If you want to make a spell more powerful, you can use an amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to cast a higher [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md), and gain the upcast benefits listed in the spell text. The [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) is treated as whatever you upcasted it to for the purposes of [The Spellcasting Roll](#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).

The level at which you upcast a spell cannot exceed your [Maximum Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Forceful Spellburn

If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you may choose to succeed it (as long as it wasn't [Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md)).

If you do this, you take [Mythril Damage](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the difference between the result and the [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md). If this damage reduces your [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) to 0, you [Die](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md#Dead). After taking this damage, you become [Exhausted](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md).
