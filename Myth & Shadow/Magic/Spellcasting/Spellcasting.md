# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle and ancient. Not even the best mages know its true nature. Hence why it is called magic. Mortals need [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder to cast [Spells](../Spells.md).

## Spellcasting Requirements

To attempt to cast a [Spell](../Spells.md):

1. You must have two free hands.
	1. Or you must be holding an item with the [Mythril Property](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md) in one of your hands.
2. You must speak a booming incantation.
3. It must be one of your [Known Spells](Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md).
4. You must use the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder specified for the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).
	1. You may consume [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) for this as well, see [Magicka Point Cost](Mythril.md#Magicka%20Point%20Cost).

## The Spellcasting Roll

To cast a [Spell](../Spells.md), you must succeed the [Magicka Point Cost](Mythril.md#Magicka%20Point%20Cost) roll for it.

On a success:

>The spell takes effect. See its text for what occurs.

On a failure:

>The spell fizzles and a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
