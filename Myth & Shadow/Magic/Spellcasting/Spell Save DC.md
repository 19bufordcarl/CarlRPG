# Spell Save DC

Sometimes, an NPC will have an ability that require the target to make a Saving Throw against their Spell Save DC. The Spell Save DC represents how difficult it is for creatures to resist the effects of their spells. A higher DC represents a more powerful caster.

This special [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) is used to determine how the target(s) of a [Spell](../Spells.md) are affected. It will specify one of the three [Attribute Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) that the PC should use to make the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). If this is their [Highest Attribute](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Highest%20Attribute.md), the PC may add their highest [Max Proficiency Bonus](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Skills.md#Max%20Proficiency%20Bonus) to the result.

A PC's Spell Save DC is equal to 8 + [Magicka](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) + [Arcana](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) [Proficiency Bonus](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Skills.md#Proficiency).
