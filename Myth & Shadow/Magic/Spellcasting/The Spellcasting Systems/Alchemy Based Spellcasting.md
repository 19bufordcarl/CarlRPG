# Alchemy Based Spellcasting

In Mithrinia, it is very rare to encounter a true mage that is capable of casting [Spells](../Spells.md) traditionally (speaking magic words and conjuring a ball of fire for example).

In Mithrinia, casters brew up potion bases, which they then activate with [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder and incantation to turn it into a magic potion. These potions can then be consumed or thrown to unleash the spell that they contain.

The rules for [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

## Generic Spellcasting Rules

1. You must have at least one [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You must have the ability to speak, move both your hands, and access the required [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).

## Alchemy Specific Rules

1. You can prepare any number of potion bases for spells you have memorized.
	1. Each potion base needs:
		1. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
		2. Purified water to bind the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder for the potions.
			1. An [Alchemist Kit](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar is required to achieve purification.
		3. The ingredients required for the potion.
			1. By default, it is assumed you can find these by foraging at camp.
	2. Potion bases only can NOT cast [Spells](../Spells.md) (you need to activate them with [Mythril](../../Mythril.md)).
2. You can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to make [A Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to imbue your potion base with the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell. On a success, the potion now contains that spell. The imbued spell's magic will fizzle from the potion at the start of your next [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
	1. As part of this [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action), you can choose to cast the imbued spell immediately.
	2. You could also wait by using the [Ready](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) action.
