# Word Based Spellcasting

In the classic high fantasy world, it is possible to cast [Spells](../Spells.md) by speaking magic words with gestures that conjure a ball of fire for example.

The rules for [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

1. You must have at least one [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You must have the ability to speak, move both your hands, and access the required [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).
3. You can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to [Cast the Spell](../Spellcasting.md).
		1. You could also hold this action by using the [Ready](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) action.
