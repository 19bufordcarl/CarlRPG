# Focus Based Spellcasting

In some fantasy worlds, it is impossible to cast [Spells](../Spells.md) traditionally (speaking magic words and conjuring a ball of fire for example). In these worlds, it may be more appropriate to require PCs to cast spells through imbuing them into a focus (wand, scroll, etc.) which can be used to "cast" spells.

The rules for [Focus Based Spellcasting](Focus%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

## Generic Spellcasting Rules

1. You must have at least one [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You must have the ability to speak, move both your hands, and access the required [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).

## Focus Specific Rules

1. You must have a suitable spellcasting focus(es) for the world (GM's choice).
	1. Focuses alone can NOT cast [Spells](../Spells.md) (you need to activate them with [Mythril](../../Mythril.md)).
2. You can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to make [A Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to imbue your focus with the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell. On a success, the focus now contains that spell. The imbued spell's magic will fizzle from the focus at the start of your next [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
	1. As part of this [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action), you can choose to cast the imbued spell immediately.
	2. You could also wait by using the [Ready](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) action.
