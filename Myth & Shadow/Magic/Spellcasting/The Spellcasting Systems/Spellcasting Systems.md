# Spellcasting Systems

There are three main systems for [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) in Mithrinia. Alchemy is the default.

1. [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (Default)
	- PCs must imbue [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into prepped potion bases to use magic.
2. [Focus Based Spellcasting](Focus%20Based%20Spellcasting.md)
	- PCs must use a spellcasting focus to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
3. [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md)
	- PCs can cast spells by using words and gestures to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
	- Only high [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) PCs (9+)
