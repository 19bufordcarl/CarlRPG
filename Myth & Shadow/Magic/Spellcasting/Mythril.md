## Carrying Mythril

Casters are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. 500 coins worth of Mythril powder can fit into a pouch that takes up an [Equipment Slot](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Equipment%20Slot.md). You can store Mythril in your coin pouch in your [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md).

Mythril [Coins](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Coins.md#Imperial%20Currency%20and%20Availability) are 100 coins worth of powder smelted into a disc. Powerful casters carry Mythril coins to cast higher level spells so they don't have to carry big bags of powder. As part of casting a spell, you may disincorporate held Mythril Coins into powder.
