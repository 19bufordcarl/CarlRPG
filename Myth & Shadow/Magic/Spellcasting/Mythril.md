# Mythril

Mythril is the single most important resource in Mithrinia. It is only through Mythril that mortal's can channel magic into their world. All [Spells](../Spells.md) use Mythril powder.

## Mythril Resource Cost

[Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) requires Mythril powder according to the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

| Spell Level | Amount of Mythril Powder Consumed |
| ----------: | --------------------------------: |
|           1 |                          10 coins |

## Carrying Mythril

Casters are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. 500 coins worth of Mythril powder can fit into a pouch that takes up an [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).

This creates a one-to-one slot correspondence between [Coins](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Coins.md) and Mythril powder, which means they can be counted together in your coin pouch in your [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md).

Mythril [Coins](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Coins.md#Imperial%20Currency%20and%20Availability) are 100 coins worth of powder condensed and melted into a single coin. Powerful casters carry Mythril coins to cast higher level spells so they don't have to lug big bags of powder. As part of casting a spell, you may disincorporate held Mythril Coins into powder.
