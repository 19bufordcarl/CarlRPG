## Carrying Mythril

Casters are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. Mythril [Coins](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Coins.md#Imperial%20Currency%20and%20Availability) are 100 coins worth of powder smelted into a disc. Powerful casters carry Mythril coins to cast higher level spells so they don't have to carry big bags of powder. As part of casting a spell, you may disincorporate held Mythril Coins into powder.
