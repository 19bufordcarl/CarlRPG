# Mythril

*Mythril* is the single most important resource in Mithrinia. It is only through *Mythril* that mortal's can channel magic into their world. All [Spells](../Spells.md) use *Mythril* powder.

## Mythril Resource Cost

[Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) requires *Mythril* powder according to the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).

| Spell Level | Amount of Mythril Powder Consumed |
| ----------: | --------------------------------: |
|           0 |                          10 coins |
|           1 |                          10 coins |
|           2 |                          25 coins |
|           3 |                         100 coins |
|           4 |                         250 coins |
|           5 |                        1000 coins |

## Magicka Point Cost

Consuming *Mythril* powder for [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) also requires you consume [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md). The amount consumed is dependent on the [Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) relative to your [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level). If you do not have enough current [Magicka Points](../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Magicka%20Points.md) for the consumption roll, you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
