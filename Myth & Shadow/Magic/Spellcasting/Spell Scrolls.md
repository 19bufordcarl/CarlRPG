# Spell Scrolls

[Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) are created by casters using [Mythril](../Mythril.md) infused ink. Casters will usually put this individual pages together in a [Spell Book](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md), but they can be loose.

Spell scrolls can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across.

## Making Spell Scrolls

A PC can scribe [Spells](Spells.md) onto a [Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md) if they have an [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) of 2 or more.

The procedure is as follows.

1. Choose a [Spell](Spells.md) you have [Memorized](Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. Infuse an inkwell with the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell.
	1. Once the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) is in the ink, it can only be used for scribing.
	2. A [Writing Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Writing%20Kit.md) has enough ink to scribe 10 spell scrolls.
3. Take a *full day* to scribe a spell.
	1. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day.

## Using Spell Scrolls

You can use a spell scroll to learn the spell or cast the spell.

### Learning Spells From Spell Scrolls

[Learning Spells](Spell%20Memorization.md#Learning%20Spells) from a scroll uses the following procedure.

1. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for the spell.
	1. On a failure, the page disintegrates, roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
	2. On a success, you [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md) the spell, and the inked scroll remains intact.
	3. If the spell was scribed by a caster using a different [Spellcasting Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) than yours, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on this roll. (See [Spell Scroll Disciplines](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Disciplines)).
2. This process takes a full day *per spell*.
	1. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) on those days.
	2. If [Interrupted](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Interruption), you must stop this process if you want to engage in combat.
		1. If you stop, roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).

### Casting Spell Scrolls

Alternatively, you can attempt to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) a [Spell](Spells.md) from a scroll directly, bypassing the need for [Memorization](Spell%20Memorization.md) and [Mythril](../Mythril.md) requirement. Doing so destroys the scroll.

1. You follow all the other normal [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) rules.
	1. If the spell was scribed by a caster using a different [Spellcasting Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) than yours, you have [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll). (See [Spell Scroll Disciplines](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Disciplines)).
	2. If the spell was higher level than your [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level) and you failed the cast, treat it as a [Critical Miscast](../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md).
2. Succeed or fail, the page disintegrates.

### Spell Scroll Disciplines

All [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) scrolls are from the [Intelligence Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md).

Most [Temple](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md) scrolls are from the [Wisdom Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Wisdom%20Discipline.md), but some are from the [Charisma Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Charisma%20Discipline.md).

The vast majority of scrolls you will find adventuring will be from the [Intelligence Discipline](The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md) as it is the most ancient, popular, and versatile discipline of spellcasting.

*If the GM does not know the discipline of the scribe of a scroll, they can roll a d100: 90 or less is intelligence, 91-99 is wisdom, 100 is charisma*
