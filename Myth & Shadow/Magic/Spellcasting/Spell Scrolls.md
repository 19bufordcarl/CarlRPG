# Spell Scrolls

[Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) are created by casters using [Mythril](../Mythril.md) infused ink. Casters will usually put this individual pages together in a [Spell Book](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md), but they can be loose.

Spell scrolls can act as a kind of memory storage for any spells the PC comes across.

## Making Spell Scrolls

A PC can scribe [Spells](Spells.md) onto a [Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md) if they have an [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) of 2 or more.

The procedure is as follows.

1. Choose a [Spell](Spells.md) you have [Memorized](Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. Infuse an inkwell with the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell.
	1. Once the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) is in the ink, it can only be used for scribing.
	2. A [Writing Kit](../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Writing%20Kit.md) has enough ink to scribe 10 spell scrolls.
3. It takes a *full day* to scribe a spell.
	1. You cannot benefit from a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) that day.

## Learning Spells From Spell Scrolls

A [Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md) let's a PC [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md) a spell during [Downtime](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) without risk.

### Spell Scroll Disciplines

All [Arcane Guild](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) scrolls are from the [Intelligence Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md).

Most [Temple](../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md) scrolls are from the [Wisdom Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Wisdom%20Discipline.md), but some are from the [Charisma Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Charisma%20Discipline.md).

The vast majority of scrolls you will find adventuring will be from the [Intelligence Discipline](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md) as it is the most ancient, popular, and versatile discipline of spellcasting.

 *If the GM cannot determine discipline of the scribe of a scroll based on the circumstances, they can determine it randomly. Roll a d100: 90 or less is intelligence, 91-99 is wisdom, 100 is charisma.*

## Charged Spell Scrolls

Charged Spell Scrolls act as a [Charged Enchantment](../Enchanting/Enchantment%20Rules.md#Charged%20Enchantments). A PC must follow the [Charging Procedure](../Enchanting/Enchanting.md#Charging%20Procedure) if they want to make them. These are the type of scrolls BX adventure supplements will usually refer to in treasure descriptions. By default, charged scrolls disintegrate after one use.
