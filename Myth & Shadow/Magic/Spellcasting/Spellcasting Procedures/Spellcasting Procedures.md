# Spellcasting Procedures

There are three main ways [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) can occur. Alchemy is the default.

1. [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (Default)
	- PCs imbue [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into **Elixirs** to use magic.
2. [Focus Based Spellcasting](Focus%20Based%20Spellcasting.md)
	- PCs use a **Magic Focus** to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
	- PCs do not start with a **Magic Focus** by default.
3. [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md)
	- PCs cast spells using words and gestures to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
	- Only high [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) PCs may learn this technique. (9th+)
