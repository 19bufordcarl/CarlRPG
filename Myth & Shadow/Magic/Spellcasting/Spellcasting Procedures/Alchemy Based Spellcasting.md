# Alchemy Based Spellcasting

In Mithrinia, it is very rare to encounter a true mage that is capable of casting [Spells](../Spells.md) traditionally (speaking magic words and conjuring a ball of fire for example).

In Mithrinia, casters usually carry around *Elixirs*, which they then imbibe to grant them the ability to cast a spell for a short time.

The rules for [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

## Generic Spellcasting Rules

1. You must have at least one [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You must have the ability to speak, move both your hands, and access the required [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).

## Alchemy Specific Rules

1. You can prepare *Elixirs* for [Spells](../Spells.md) you have memorized.
	1. Each *Elixir* needs:
		1. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
		2. Purified water and the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder required for the [Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md).
			1. An [Alchemist Kit](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar is required to achieve purification.
		3. The ingredients required for the *Elixir*.
			1. You can find these by foraging at camp over a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
	2. An *Elixir* takes a [Delve Round](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to brew.
2. On your [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to imbibe an *Elixir* and cast its spell as if you had access to [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md).
	1. *To clarify: This works with the [Ready](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) action.*

## Aiding Elixirs

To apply a buffing elixir (heals, buffs, etc.) with a range of touch, the caster administers the elixir to the target directly. The caster still makes a [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to activate the magic in the elixir.
