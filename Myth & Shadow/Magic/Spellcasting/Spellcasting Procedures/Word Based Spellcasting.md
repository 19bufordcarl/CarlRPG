# Word Based Spellcasting

For PCs that are [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 9 or higher, their magical might has become powerful enough that it is possible for them to cast [Spells](../Spells.md) by simply speaking magic words with gestures.

The rules for [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

1. You must have the [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You must be able to speak, move both your hands, and access the required [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).
3. You can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to [Cast the Spell](../Spellcasting.md).

Casting a spell through words creates an echoing sonic boom.
