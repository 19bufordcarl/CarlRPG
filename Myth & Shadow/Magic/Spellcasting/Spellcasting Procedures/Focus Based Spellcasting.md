# Focus Based Spellcasting

**Requires a Magic Focus**
The PCs may uncover magical focuses in their adventures that let them cast spells by imbuing [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into the focus rather than needing to do [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md). Classic magical focuses include artifacts like wands, staves, rods, books, etc.

So long as a PC is wielding their focus, they may cast spells with [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md).

## FAQ

*It is OK if you decide to give the PCs access to these focuses at level 1 if do not like the rules for alchemy based spellcasting, but note that the worldbuilding of Mithrinia is based on the fact that magic requires precise alchemy, transportation of elixirs enmasse, and is random. Magic may be used in war, but it does not dominate the battlefield. It is both risky and a logistical nightmare.*
