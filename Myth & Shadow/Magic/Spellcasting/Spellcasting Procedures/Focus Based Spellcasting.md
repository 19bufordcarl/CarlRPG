# Focus Based Spellcasting

The PCs may uncover magical focuses in their adventures that let them cast spells by imbuing [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into the focus rather than needing to do [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md). Classic magical focuses include artifacts like wands, staves, rods, books, etc.

The rules for [Focus Based Spellcasting](Focus%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

## Generic Spellcasting Rules

1. You must have at least one [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You must have the ability to speak, move both your hands, and access the required [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).

## Focus Specific Rules

1. You must have a suitable spellcasting focus.
	1. Focuses alone can NOT cast [Spells](../Spells.md) (you need to activate them with [Mythril](../../Mythril.md)).
2. You can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) to make [A Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to imbue your focus with the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell. On a success, the focus now contains that spell. The imbued spell's magic will fizzle from the focus at the start of your next [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
	1. As part of this [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action), you can choose to cast the imbued spell immediately.
	2. You could also wait by using the [Ready](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) action.

Casting a spell from a focus requires that the incantation is loud, with an arcane echoing boom.

## FAQ

*It is OK if you decide to give the PCs access to these focuses at level 1 if you want to streamline spellcasting, but note that the worldbuilding of Mithrinia is based on the fact that magic requires precise alchemy, transportation of elixirs enmasse, and is fickle to boot. This is why magic is used in war, but does not dominate the battlefields. It is risky and a logistical nightmare.*
