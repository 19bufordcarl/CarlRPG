# Saving Throw

Sometimes, a spell lets the affected target(s) make a Saving Throw. A saving throw is a special kind of [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) made against the caster's [Spell Save DC](Saving%20Throw.md#Spell%20Save%20DC).

## Spell Save DC

Any creature capable of using magic has a Spell Save DC.

This is a special type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) that is used to determine if the affected target(s) of a [Spell](../Spells.md) are affected or not.

A PC's spell save DC is equal to 10 + [Magicka](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) + [Arcana](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) Proficiency Bonus.

### Lesser Spell Save DC

Certain spells that have more debilitating control effects use your lesser spell save DC.

A PC's lesser spell save DC is equal to 8 + [Magicka](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) + [Arcana](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) Proficiency Bonus.
