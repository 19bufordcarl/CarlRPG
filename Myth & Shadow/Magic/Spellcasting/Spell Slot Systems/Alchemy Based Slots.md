# Alchemy Based Spell Slots

## Spell Alchemy Procedure

Spell alchemy lets PCs do rapid [Alchemy](../../Alchemy/Alchemy.md). It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Alchemy Ability](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md#Alchemy%20Ability).
2. Sterile containers, usually [Glass Vials](../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. Purified water to bind the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder for the potions.
	1. An [Alchemist Kit](../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar is required to achieve purification.
4. The number of potions and the spell levels thereof is determined by your [Alchemy Ability](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md#Alchemy%20Ability).
	1. Alchemy can only be done during dawn or dusk, this magical period lasts 1 hour.
		1. A PC can only brew potions at dawn *or* dusk in a day, not both.
	2. Spell potions lose their magic at the next dawn or dusk, respectively.
		1. A potion brewed at dawn loses its magic the next dawn.

### Alchemy Ability

A PC's Alchemy Ability determines the number of potions they can brew in a day. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). This is their [Spell Slot Ability](Spell%20Slots.md#Spell%20Slot%20Ability).
