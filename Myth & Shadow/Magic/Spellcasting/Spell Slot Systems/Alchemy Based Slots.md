# Alchemy Based Spell Slots

## Quick Brewing Procedure

Quick brewing lets PCs do rapid [Alchemy](../../Alchemy/Alchemy.md). It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Alchemy Ability](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md#Alchemy%20Ability).
2. Sterile containers, usually [Glass Vials](../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. The [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required for all the [Alchemy Slots](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md#Alchemy%20Slots).
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. You can brew a number of potions per [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest) as determined by your [Alchemy Ability](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md#Alchemy%20Ability).
	1. Quick brew potions lose their magic at the next dawn.
		1. Or after 20 hours (5 [Watches](../../../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md)) if the precise time is required.
	2. Quick brewing takes 1 hour, it can be done at the end of a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).

### Alchemy Ability

A PC's Alchemy Ability determines the number of potions they can brew in a day. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). This is their spell slot ability. See the [Spell Slot Tables](Spell%20Slot%20Tables.md).
