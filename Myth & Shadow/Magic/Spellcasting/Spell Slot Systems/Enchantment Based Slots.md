## Enchanting Foci Procedure

Focus [Enchanting](../../Enchanting/Enchanting.md) lets PCs store spells in magic items called spell foci.

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
2. An item of your choosing to bind the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder consumed.
	1. *Classically, mages would use a wooden wand as a focus*
3. The [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required for all the [Enchantment Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots).
4. You get [Enchantment Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots) as determined by your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
	1. Foci lose their enchantment at the next dawn / dusk.
		1. Or after 20 hours (5 [Watches](../../../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md)) if the precise time is required.
	2. Foci enchanting takes 1 hour, it can be done at the end of a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
	3. An [Enchantment Slot](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots) can be expended to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md#Spellcasting) any [Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md) spell.

### Enchanting Ability

A PC's Enchanting Ability determines the number of foci they can enchant in a day. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). This is their spell slot ability. See the [Spell Slot Tables](Spell%20Slot%20Tables.md).
