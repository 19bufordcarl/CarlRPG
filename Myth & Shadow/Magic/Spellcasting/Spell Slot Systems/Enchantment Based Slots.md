## Enchanting Foci Procedure

Focus enchanting lets PCs store [Spell Slots](Spell%20Slots.md) in items called foci. A focus holds one spell slot.

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
2. Items (foci) of your choosing to bind the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder consumed.
	1. *Classically, mages would use wooden or silver wands as foci*
3. The number and level of foci you can enchant is determined by your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
	1. Enchanting can only be done during dawn or dusk, this magical period lasts 1 hour.
		1. A PC can only enchant at dawn *or* dusk in a day, not both.
	2. Foci lose their magic at the next dawn or dusk, respectively.
		1. A focus enchanted at dawn loses its magic the next dawn.

### Enchanting Ability

A PC's Enchanting Ability determines the number of foci they can enchant in a day. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). This is their [Spell Slot Ability](Spell%20Slots.md#Spell%20Slot%20Ability).
