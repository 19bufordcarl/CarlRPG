# Enchanting Based Spell Slots

## Quick Charging Procedure

Quick charging lets PCs do rapid [Enchanting](../../Enchanting/Enchanting.md). It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
2. A [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../Mythril.md) item (*a focus, typically a staff or wand*).
	1. [Silvered](../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. The [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required for all the [Enchantment Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots).
4. You get [Enchantment Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots) as determined by your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
	1. Quick charge items lose their charges at the next dawn.
		1. Or after 20 hours (5 [Watches](../../../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md)) if the precise time is required.
	2. Quick charging takes 1 hour, it can be done at the end of a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
		1. You can only do one quick charge per [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
	3. An [Enchantment Slot](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots) can be used as a charge for [Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md) spells.
		1. See [Using Charges](../../Enchanting/Enchantment%20Rules.md#Using%20Charges).

### Enchanting Ability

A PC's Enchanting Ability determines the amount of magic they can imbue their focus with. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). Each slot costs [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).
