# Enchantment Based Spell Slots

## Enchanting Focuses Procedure

Focus [Enchanting](../../Enchanting/Enchanting.md) lets PCs store spells in magic items called a spellcasting focus.

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md).
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) to be at least 4.
		1. Treat it as if it were 3 less when determining your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
2. A [Silvered](../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md) item (*a focus, typically a staff or wand*).
	1. [Silvered](../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. The [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required for all the [Enchantment Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots).
4. You get [Enchantment Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots) as determined by your [Enchanting Ability](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchanting%20Ability).
	1. Focuses lose any unused enchantment slots at the next dawn.
		1. Or after 20 hours (5 [Watches](../../../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md)) if the precise time is required.
	2. Focus enchanting takes 1 hour, it can be done at the end of a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
		1. You can only enchant one focus once per [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
	3. An [Enchantment Slot](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md#Enchantment%20Slots) can be expended to [Cast](../Spellcasting.md#Spellcasting) any [Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md) spell.

### Enchanting Ability

A PC's Enchanting Ability determines the amount of magic they can imbue their focus with. It is the *lesser* of their [Spellcasting Ability](../../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and their [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). Each slot costs [Mythril](../../Mythril.md).
