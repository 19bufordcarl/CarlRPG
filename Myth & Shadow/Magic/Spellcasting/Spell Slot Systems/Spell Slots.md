# Spell Slots

*Optional Rule (Recommended if spell slots are desired instead of roll to cast)*

If you use [Spell Slots](Spell%20Slots.md), then PCs are incapable of [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).

You can have a spell slot system that uses either [Alchemy](../../Alchemy/Alchemy.md) or [Enchanting](../../Enchanting/Enchanting.md) as the base.

1. [Alchemy Based Slots](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md): Great for low fantasy settings. *It mimics BX spell slots.*
2. [Enchantment Based Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md): Better for higher fantasy settings. *It mimics 5e spell slots.*
