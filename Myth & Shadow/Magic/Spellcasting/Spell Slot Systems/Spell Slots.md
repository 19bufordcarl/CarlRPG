# Spell Slots

*Optional Rule (Recommended if spell slots are desired instead of roll to cast)*

If you use [Spell Slots](Spell%20Slots.md), then PCs are incapable of normal [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md).

You can have a spell slot system that uses either [Alchemy](../../Alchemy/Alchemy.md) or [Enchanting](../../Enchanting/Enchanting.md) as the base.

The first, [Alchemy Based Slots](Alchemy%20Based%20Slots.md), is great for low fantasy settings. *It mimics BX spell slots.*

The second, [Enchantment Based Slots](Enchantment%20Based%20Slots.md), is better higher fantasy settings. *It mimics 5e spell slots.*
