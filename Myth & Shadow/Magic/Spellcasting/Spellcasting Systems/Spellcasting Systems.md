# Spellcasting Systems

There are three main systems for [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) in Myth & Shadow. Alchemy is the default.

1. [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (Low Fantasy) -- **Default**
	- PCs must imbue [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into prepped potion bases to use magic.
2. [Focus Based Spellcasting](Focus%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (High Fantasy)
	- PCs must use a spellcasting focus to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
3. [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (High Fantasy)
	- PCs can cast spells by using words and gestures to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
