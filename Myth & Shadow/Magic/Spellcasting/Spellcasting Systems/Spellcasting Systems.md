# Spellcasting Systems

There are three main systems for [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting.md) in Myth & Shadow

1. [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (Default)
	- PCs must imbue [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into prepped potion bases to use magic.
- [Focus Based Spellcasting](Focus%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (Medium Fantasy)
	- PCs must use a spellcasting focus to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
- [Word Based Spellcasting](Word%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) (High Fantasy)
	- PCs can cast spells by using words and gestures to channel [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) into spells.
