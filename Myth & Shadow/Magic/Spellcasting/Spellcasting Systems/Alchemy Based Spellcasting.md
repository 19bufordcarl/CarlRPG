# Alchemy Based Spellcasting

In some lower fantasy worlds, it is impossible to cast [Spells](../Spells.md) traditionally (speaking magic words and conjuring a ball of fire for example). In these worlds, it may be more appropriate to require PCs to brew up potions, which can be used to "cast" spells.

The rules for [Alchemy Based Spellcasting](Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md) are as follows:

1. You must have at least one [Spell Memorized](../Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. You can prepare any number of potion bases for spells you have memorized.
	1. Each potion base needs:
		1. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
		2. Purified water to bind the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) powder for the potions.
			1. An [Alchemist Kit](../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar is required to achieve purification.
		3. The ingredients required for the potion.
			1. By default, it is assumed you can find these by foraging at camp.
	2. Potion bases can NOT cast [Spells](../Spells.md).
3. When you have a potion base, you can take a [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action) make [A Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to add the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell. On a success, the potion now contains that spell. The imbued spell will fizzle at the start of your next [Turn](../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md).
	1. As part of this [Slow Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action), you can also drink or throw the potion bottle.
		1. You could also wait by using the [Ready](../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md#Ready) action.
		2. See [Potion Rules](../../Alchemy/Potion%20Rules.md).
