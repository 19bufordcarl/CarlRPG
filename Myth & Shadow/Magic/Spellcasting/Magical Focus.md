# Magical Focus

It is only through a magical focus that a mortal is capable of [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md).

A magical focus can be any sort of magical item that takes up 1 [Item Slot](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slot.md).
*Examples: A Spell Book, A Wand, A Staff, A Rod, etc.*

## Spells Granted

Each magical focus grants their caster the ability to cast **one spell**. In order to learn new [Spells](../Spells.md), a PC must craft or acquire a new magical focus for that spell.

## Discipline

A magical focus determines the [Spellcasting Discipline](Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) used for casting its spell.

## Crafting Magical Focuses

A PC can craft magical focuses over the course of [Downtime](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime). They must have the [Spell Memorized](Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) in order to be able to craft a magical focus for it. The magical focus' discipline is determined by the [Spellcasting Discipline](Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) that the PC learned the spell from.

A magical focus costs a PC the [Mythril](Mythril.md) required to cast that spell in crafting costs.

## Finding Magical Focuses

A PC may find a magical focus for a spell when adventuring. They may also borrow one from a fellow PC. A PC must be proficient with the [Spellcasting Discipline](Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Disciplines.md) of a magical focus in order to be able to wield it for [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md).

The first time you attempt to cast a spell from a focus you did not craft, you do so with [Disadvantage](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md). If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you are unable to figure out how to use this magical focus. You may retry this focus only after you [Level Up](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).
