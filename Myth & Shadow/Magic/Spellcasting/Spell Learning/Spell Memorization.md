# Spell Memorization

PCs can memorize [Spells](../../Spells.md) of a level less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

PCs can only memorize [Spells](../../Spells.md) from one of their [Learned Domains](Learned%20Domains.md).

## Number of Spells Memorized

A PC's max number of memorized spells is equal to their [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).

If [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), double your max number of memorized spells.

## Spell Learning Requirement
