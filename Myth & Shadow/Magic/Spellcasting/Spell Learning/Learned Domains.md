# Learned Domains

A PC can only cast [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of the [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) that the PC has learned.

The max number of [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) a PC can know is determined by their [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).

## Max Spell Domains

| Mental Defense | Max Number of Known Spell Domains |
| -------------: | --------------------------------: |
|      0 or less |                                 0 |
|            1-5 |                                 1 |
|            6-9 |                                 2 |
|            10+ |                                 3 |

If [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), increase your max number of known [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) by 1.

## Learning a New Domain

If able, a PC may learn a new domain over [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md) or [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) that uses that domain. This can be done when the PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They will need to pay for initiation and training totaling 500 coins, and they need a [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting%20Ability.md) of at least 3.
