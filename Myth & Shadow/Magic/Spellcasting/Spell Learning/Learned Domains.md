# Learned Domains

A PC can only cast [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of the [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) that they have learned.

The max number of [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) a PC can know is determined by their [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).

## Max Spell Domains

| Mental Defense | Max Known Spell Domains |
| -------------: | ----------------------: |
|      0 or less |                       0 |
|            1-5 |                       1 |
|            6-9 |                       2 |
|            10+ |                       3 |

If [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) is your [Primary Skill](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Primary%20Skill.md), use the following table instead.

| Mental Defense | Max Known Spell Domains |
| -------------: | ----------------------: |
|      0 or less |                       1 |
|            1-3 |                       2 |
|            4-6 |                       3 |
|            7-8 |                       4 |
|              9 |                       5 |
|            10+ |                       6 |

## Learning a New Domain

PCs do not learn new domains automatically when they [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). A PC can only learn new domains by studying at an [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) or [Holy Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md) over [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).

In order to learn a new domain, a PC needs to pay the [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) or for initiation and training totaling 500 coins, and they need to have a [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) of at least 2.
