# Learned Domains

A PC can only cast [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of the [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) that they have learned.

A PC's [Max Spell Domains](Learned%20Domains.md#Max%20Spell%20Domains) is determined by their [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) and [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md).

## Max Spell Domains

| Mental Defense | Base Known Spell Domains |
| -------------: | -----------------------: |
|      0 or less |                        0 |
|            1-5 |                        1 |
|            6-9 |                        2 |
|            10+ |                        3 |

### Additional Spell Domains

Having a high [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) allows you to learn more [Spell Domains](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md).

| Intelligence | Additional Known Spell Domains |
| -----------: | -----------------------------: |
|    0 or less |                              0 |
|          1-5 |                              1 |
|          6-9 |                              2 |
|          10+ |                              3 |

## Learning a New Domain

PCs do not learn new domains automatically when they [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up).

A PC can learn new domains by studying them over [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).

In order to learn a new domain over [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md), a PC needs to pay for learning materials totaling at least 500 coins, and they need to have a [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) of at least 2.

This usually happens at an [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) or [Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Temple.md).

### Other Domains

You may choose to learn of the following instead of a [Spell Domain](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md).

1. Learn how to craft [Weapon Oils](../../Crafting/Weapon%20Oils.md).
2. You *Master* one [Spell](../../Spells.md) you know, letting you use [Forceful Spellburn](Learned%20Domains.md#Forceful%20Spellburn) for it.

### Forceful Spellburn

If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you may force it to be a success, unless it was a [Critical Miscast](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).

To do so, you take [Mythril Damage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) equal to the difference of failed [Check](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and the [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md).

If this damage reduces your [Hit Points](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) to 0, you [Die](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md#Dead) instantly.

You may only use *Forceful Spellburn* for [Spells](../../Spells.md) you have *Mastered*.
