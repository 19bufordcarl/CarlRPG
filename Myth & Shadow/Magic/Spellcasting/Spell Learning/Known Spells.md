# Known Spells

PCs can learn [Spells](../../Spells.md) of a level less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

PCs can only learn [Spells](../../Spells.md) from one of their [Learned Domains](Learned%20Domains.md).

## Max Known Spells

A PC's max number of known spells is equal to their [Mental Defense](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) + [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md).

## Spell Learning

When a PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), they can learn any number of new [Spells](../../Spells.md) that share one of their [Learned Domains](Learned%20Domains.md) so long as they do not exceed their [Max Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md#Max%20Known%20Spells).

### Replacing Spells

A PC may replace any of their [Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md) with new [Spells](../../Spells.md) when they [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).
