# Known Spells

PCs can learn [Spells](../../Spells.md) with a [Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Max Known Spells

A PC's max number of known spells is equal to twice their [Magicka](../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) plus their [Arcana](../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) bonus.

## Spell Learning

When a PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up), they can learn any number of new [Spells](../../Spells.md) so long as they do not exceed their [Max Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md#Max%20Known%20Spells), provided the GM determines they have sufficient [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) and resources.

*Alternatively, a PC can use spell book or scroll to learn new [Spells](../../Spells.md).*

### Replacing Spells

A PC may replace any of their [Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md) with new [Spells](../../Spells.md) when they [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up), provided the GM determines they have sufficient [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) and resources.
