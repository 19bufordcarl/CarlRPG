# Magic Apprenticeships

The main way a PC can access spell tutors is to be a member of an appropriate guild and spend the appropriate guild dues for learning a spell of the given level.

## Arcane Study

The [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) of the Mithrinian Empire takes apprentices.

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild only teaches spells to initiated members in good standing.*
- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells](../../Spells.md) associated with the [Death](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.*

- *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells 4th Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md) or higher, except to those with a letter of recommendation from a Chapter's Archmage.*

## Temple Study

The [Holy Temples](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md) across Mithrinia take acolytes.

- *Per Imperial Law, Temples may only teach spells to initiated members in good standing.*

Temples only teach [Spells](../../Spells.md) that have a [Domain](../../Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) associated with their [Deity](../../Deities.md).
