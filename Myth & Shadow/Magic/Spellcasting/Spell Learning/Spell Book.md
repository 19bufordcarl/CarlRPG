# Spell Book

A *Spell Book* is created by a caster using [Mythril](../Mythril.md) infused ink.

*Spell Books* can act as a kind of memory storage for any spells the PC comes across.

## Making Spell Books

A PC can scribe [Spells](../../Spells.md) onto a *Spell Book* if they have an [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) of 2 or more.

The procedure is as follows.

1. Choose a [Spell](../../Spells.md) you have [Memorized](Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. Have [Blank Book](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md) ready.
3. Infuse an inkwell with the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell.
	1. Once the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) is in the ink, it can only be used for scribing.
	2. A [Writing Kit](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Writing%20Kit.md) has enough ink to scribe 10 *Spell Books*.
4. It takes a *full day* to scribe a *Spell Book*.

## Learning Spells from Spell Books

A *Spell Book* let's a PC [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md) a spell during [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) without risk.

### Spell Book Disciplines

All [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Arcane%20Guild.md) *Spell Books* are from the [Intelligence Discipline](../Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md).

Most [Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md) *Spell Books* are from the [Wisdom Discipline](../Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Wisdom%20Discipline.md).

The vast majority of *Spell Books* you will find adventuring will be from the [Intelligence Discipline](../Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Intelligence%20Discipline.md) as it is the most ancient, popular, and versatile discipline of spellcasting.

 *If the GM cannot determine discipline of a book based on the circumstances, they can determine it randomly. Roll a d100: 90 or less is intelligence, 91-99 is wisdom, 100 is charisma.*
