# Spell Book

A *Spell Book* is created by a caster using [Mythril](../Mythril.md) infused ink.

## Making Spell Books

A PC can scribe [Spells](../../Spells.md) into a *Spell Book* with the following procedure:

1. Choose one of your [Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md).
2. Have an [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) of at least 2.
3. Have [Blank Book](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md) ready.
4. Infuse an inkwell with the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell.
	1. Once the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) is in the ink, it can only be used for scribing.
	2. A [Writing Kit](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Writing%20Kit.md) has enough ink to scribe 10 *Spell Books*.
5. It takes a *full day* to scribe a *Spell Book*.

## Learning Spells from Spell Books

A *Spell Book* let's a PC [Learn](Known%20Spells.md#Spell%20Learning) a spell. This takes a *full day*.

*Note: This does not let a PC exceed their [Max Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md#Max%20Known%20Spells).*

### Lore

*You can buy spell books from the [Arcane Guild](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) or a [Holy Temple](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Holy%20Temple.md). Per Imperial Law, you must be a member of one of these orders in good standing. You can only get access to spell books for [4th Level Spells](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/4th%20Level%20Spells.md) or greater with a direct recommendation from the Archmage or Archpriest.*
