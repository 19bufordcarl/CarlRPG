# Spell Book

A *Spell Book* is created by a caster using [Mythril](../Mythril.md) infused ink.

## Making Spell Books

A PC can scribe [Spells](../../Spells.md) into a *Spell Book* with the following procedure:

1. Choose a [Spell](../../Spells.md) you have [Memorized](Spell%20Memorization.md).
2. Have an [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) of at least 2.
3. Have [Blank Book](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md) ready.
4. Infuse an inkwell with the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast the spell.
	1. Once the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) is in the ink, it can only be used for scribing.
	2. A [Writing Kit](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Writing%20Kit.md) has enough ink to scribe 10 *Spell Books*.
5. It takes a *full day* to scribe a *Spell Book*.

## Learning Spells from Spell Books

A *Spell Book* let's a PC [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md) a spell during [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) without risk.
