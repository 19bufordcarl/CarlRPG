# Known Cantrips

PCs can only learn [Cantrips](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Cantrips/{Cantrips}.md) over [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) with appropriate resources per the GM's discretion. Cantrips represent magical skills that a PC has learned so deeply that they become the ritualistic process required to bind them to the arcane firmament.

## Max Known Cantrips

A PC's max number of known cantrips is equal to their [Magicka](../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md).

## Cantrip Learning

When a PC [Levels Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up), they can learn any number of new [Cantrips](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Cantrips/{Cantrips}.md) so long as they do not exceed their [Max Known Cantrips](Known%20Cantrips.md#Max%20Known%20Cantrips), provided the GM determines they have sufficient [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) and resources.

### Replacing Spells

A PC may replace any of their [Known Spells](Known%20Spells.md) with new [Spells](../../Spells.md) when they [Level Up](../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md#Level%20Up), provided the GM determines they have sufficient [Downtime](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) and resources.

*Sometimes, a GM might say a PC needs a spell book, scroll, or similar to learn new [Spells](../../Spells.md).*
