# Area of Effect (AOE)
Spells with a designated AOE apply some portion of their spell text to all creatures in the affected area. There are two types of area of effect.
## Cube
If playing on a square grid, it is recommended to use chess king movement as opposed to Euclidean geometry. Since a diagonal is the same distance as non-diagonal in this system, that means that spheres are abstracted to be cubes, hence why everything is cube. It make measurement much easier and less finicky to decide which creatures can and can't be affected.
### Geometry Note
Any AOE that has square as the epicenter would correlated to an cube size ending in 5 (5', 15', 25', etc.) A 5' cube is equivalent to just your square, and so isn't used. A 15' square means anything within melee range of you, and so will be used sometimes. 25' and up will not be used . Any AOE that has the intersection point of four squares would correlate to a cube size ending in 0 (10', 20', 30'). If the spell says centered on you, you can choose any vertex of the square you occupy to center the spell. Think of this as the direction your character is facing.
## Line
If playing on a square grid, then treat this as queen movement a number of squares equal to the range.
## Measurement System
If playing with a classic measurement system (typically 5' in game = 1" on the board) then you can use spheres instead of cubes, just divide the cube size in half (rounded down to the nearest 5') to get the radius. This distinction is merely so that whatever area of effect is specified is as easy as possible to represent on the board. Using cubes in measurement or spheres in grids is overly detailed for the level of abstraction we have here. As long as your game is consistent that is was matters.
