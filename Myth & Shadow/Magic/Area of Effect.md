# Area of Effect (AOE)
Spells with a designated AOE apply some portion of their spell text to all creatures in the affected area. There are two types of area of effect.
## Cube
If playing on a square grid, it is recommended to use chess king movement as opposed to Euclidean geometry. Since a diagonal is the same distance as a non-diagonal in this system, that means that spheres are abstracted to be cubes, hence why everything is cube.
### Geometry Note
Any AOE that has square as the epicenter would correlated to an cube size ending in 5 (5', 15', 25', etc.) A 5' cube is equivalent to just your square, and so isn't used. If a spell states, "within 15 feet of (a point)", that point is taken to be the intersection point of 4 squares. This equates to a 30 foot (30') cube centered on that intersection. If the spell states "within 30 feet of (caster)", then this equates to a 65 foot cube centered on the caster. For ease of language and compatibility with other measurement systems, within X feet is always the specification. It make measurement much easier and less finicky to decide which creatures can and can't be affected.
## Line
If playing on a square grid, then treat this as queen movement a number of squares equal to the range.
## Measurement System
If playing with a classic measurement system (typically 5' in game = 1" on the board) then you can use spheres instead of cubes, just divide the cube size in half (rounded down to the nearest 5') to get the radius. This distinction is merely so that whatever area of effect is specified is as easy as possible to represent on the board. Using cubes in measurement or spheres in grids is overly detailed for the level of abstraction we have here. As long as your game is consistent that is was matters.
