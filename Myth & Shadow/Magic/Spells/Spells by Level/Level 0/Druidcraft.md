Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range.

**_Weather Sensor._** You create a Tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for a few seconds.

**_Bloom._** You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.

**_Sensory Effect._** You create a harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, spectral dancing fairies, a gentle breeze, the sound of an animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect can be no bigger than a medium sized creature.

**_Fire Play._** You light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a campfire.
