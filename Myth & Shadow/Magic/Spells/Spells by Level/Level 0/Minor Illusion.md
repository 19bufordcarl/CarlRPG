| Level    | [0th Level Spell](0th%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until Dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration or otherwise dispelled via inspection. See the descriptions below for the effects of each.

If the GM determines that a creature would be suspicious of the sound, they may have you roll a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 + the creature's [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)). Every suspicious creature can force you to make this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) once per reason they have to investigate the illusion.

**_Sound._** If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

**_Image._** If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a medium sized creature. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image automatically reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

_Upgrade: The range increases by 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1._
