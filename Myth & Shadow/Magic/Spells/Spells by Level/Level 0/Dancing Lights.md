# Dancing Lights

| Level    | [Cantrip]({Cantrips}.md)                                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until Dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You create up to four torch-size lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover for the duration. Alternatively, you combine the four lights into one glowing Medium form that is vaguely humanlike. Whichever form you choose, each light illuminates a roughly 10 foot radius.

Once per [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can move the lights up to 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) within range. A light vanishes if it exceeds the spell's range.

*Upgrade: Create 4 additional lights per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
