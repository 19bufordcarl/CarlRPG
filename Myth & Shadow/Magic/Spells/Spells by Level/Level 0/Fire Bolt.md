| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled                                                       |

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it acts like a [Torch](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Torch%20Kit.md). The spell ends if you cast it again.

When you cast this spell, you can choose to immediately hurl the flame at a target you can see within range. The target takes 1d10 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) damage and sets non-worn flammable items on fire.

Until the spell ends, you can take an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to hurl the flame at a target within range.

*Upcast: Deal 1d10 additional damage per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
