You channel the chill of death into the bones of one target you can see within range.

The target makes a [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Save%20DC.md) or takes 1d10 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and cannot regain [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
