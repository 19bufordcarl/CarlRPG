You touch a target with lightning crackling between your fingers.

The affected target makes a [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Save%20DC.md) or takes 1d12 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and cannot [Opportunity Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Opportunity%20Attack.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
