You shoot a beam of frost energy at a target you can see within range.

The affected target makes a [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Save%20DC.md) or takes 1d8 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage. If the target is a creature standing on the ground, they fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md).

---
*Upgrade: Deal 1d8 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
