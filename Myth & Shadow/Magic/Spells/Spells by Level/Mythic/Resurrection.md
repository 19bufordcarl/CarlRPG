| Domains  | [Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md), [Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) |

You touch one corpse, that has been dead for at most 3 days, speaking the holy incantation reclaiming their soul and lifeforce.

The creature is brought back to life. It's [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) score is -4. Each [Long Rest](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest) the creature takes restores it's [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) by 1 until it reaches a value of whatever it was prior to death.

Any rot on the body is undone and most damage on the body is undone, such as gashes or wounds. Any missing limbs or other appendages regrow as well.

In case of decapitation or other severe destruction of the body, this spell may fail to cleave soul to flesh, and a more true resurrection ritual is required.

If the day long casting ritual is interrupted, you suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) and the soul is forever lost.

***Scribes Note***
*While the historical record shows some notes of a spell such as this, it is not to be considered seriously in academic circles, such restoration of the soul is beyond the reach of mortals. Perhaps the records have confused this with particularly powerful healing magicks on one who was near death but whose soul had not fully been severed from the body yet.*
