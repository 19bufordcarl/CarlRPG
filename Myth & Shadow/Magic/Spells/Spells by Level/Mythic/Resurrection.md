You touch one corpse, that has been dead for at most 3 days, speaking the incantation to rebind their soul to their flesh.

The creature is brought back to life. It's [Attribute Scores](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) are all -3. Each [Long Rest](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest) the creature takes restores them by 1 until they reach the value they were prior to the creature's death.

Any rot on the body is undone and most damage on the body is undone, such as gashes or wounds. Any missing limbs or other appendages regrow as well.

In case of decapitation or other severe destruction of the body, this spell may fail to rebind the soul to their body, and a more true resurrection ritual is required.

If the ritual is interrupted, you suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) and the soul is forever lost.

***Scribe's Note***
*While the historical record shows some notes of a spell such as this, they are not taken seriously in academic circles. Such restoration of the soul is beyond the reach of mortals. Perhaps the records have confused this with particularly powerful healing magicks on one who was near death but whose soul had not fully been severed from the body yet.*
