# Lesser Forcefield

| Level    | [3rd Level Spell](3rd%20Level%20Spells.md)          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | 1 hour                                              |
| Range    | Touch                                               |
| Domains  | [Earth](../../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md)          |

You touch one creature, and grant it [Immunity](../../../../Conditions/Immune.md) to [Mundane Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) for the duration. If the creature takes 10 or more [Mundane Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) from a single source, the forcefield stops 10 of the damage from that source. The forcefield then breaks and the spell ends.

*Upcast: Increase the damage threshold by 5 per spell level.*
