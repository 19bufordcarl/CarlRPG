You can commune with plants you can see within range for the duration.

Choose one:

- **Ensnare**: The plants ensnare up to 6 targets, they are [Restrained](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md).
- **Growth**: As part of casting the spell or as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) on a following [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you may have the plants move any target up to 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) in any direction.
- **Improvise**: An effect of similar power.

Affected creatures may use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.
