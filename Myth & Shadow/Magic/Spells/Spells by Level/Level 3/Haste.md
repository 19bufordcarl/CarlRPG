You touch a creature and imbue it with magical speed for the duration.

The creature gains a +5 bonus to their [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md).

When this spell ends, the creature is [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) until their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) as it becomes lethargic.

If you cast this spell on an unwilling target, they make a DC 16 wisdom check to resist this spell.

---
*Upcast: Increase the dexterity bonus by 1 and the DC by 2 per spell level*
