You have your form and gear turn into a cloud of mist for the duration.

Your movement speed becomes 300 feet, you can move with all 6 degrees of freedom in space, and you can squeeze through any spaces that mist could seep into.

You are aware of your surroundings, but cannot interact with the world in any meaningful way, and cannot [Cast Spells](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) while transformed. *This means you can neither deal nor take damage.*
