You sanctify the area around you. Create a 10 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you that moves with you for the duration.

Creatures and any [Spells](../../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) associated with the [Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain cannot enter the aura. If you move within 10 feet of them, they are magically pushed back, always remaining just outside of the aura.

Any creatures that are level 5 or higher can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) to resist this spell. They are able to cross the boundary without being pushed back.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
