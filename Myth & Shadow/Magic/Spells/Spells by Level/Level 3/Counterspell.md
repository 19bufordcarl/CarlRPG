## To Dispel an Existing Spell

You choose one target you can see within range and end one [Spell](../../../Spells.md) affecting that target.

If the targeted spell is a higher [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) than the [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) that this spell was cast at, make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 30 [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md). On a failure, the spell is not dispelled.

## To Counter a Spell as it is Cast

*You must [Ready](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) this spell in order to do this*.

You choose one creature you can see within range when they [Cast](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) a [Spell](../../../Spells.md) to negate it.

If the targeted spell is a higher [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) than the [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) that this spell was cast at, make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md). On a failure, the spell is not negated.
