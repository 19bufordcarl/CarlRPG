## To Dispel an Existing Spell

You choose one target you can see within range and end one [Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) affecting that target.

If that [Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) is a higher level than the level this [Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) was cast at, make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, the target spell is not dispelled.

*This does not dispel unique magic effects, only spell*

## To Counter a Spell as it is Cast

(You must [Ready](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md#Ready) this spell in order to do this. *This spell is not a [Slow Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Slow%20Action).*)

You choose one caster you can see within range when they cast a spell to negate that spell. You may know the spell being cast, and you may cast this after the GM makes the related die rolls.

If the [Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) is [2nd Level Spell](../../Spell%20Level.md) or lower, it is immediately countered.

If the [Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) is [3rd Level Spell](../../Spell%20Level.md) or higher, compare the result of your [Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to the target's [Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll). If yours is higher, the spell is countered. If it is a tie or worse, the spell resolves normally.
