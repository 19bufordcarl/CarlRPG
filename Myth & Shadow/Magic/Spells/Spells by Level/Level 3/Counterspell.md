## To Dispel an Existing Spell

*This does not dispel all magic, only spells*

You choose one target you can see within range and end one [Spell](../../../Spells.md) affecting that target.

If that [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is a higher level than the level this [Spell](../../../Spells.md) was cast at, make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 30 [Spellcasting Ability](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) check. On a failure, the spell is not dispelled.

## To Counter a Spell as it is Cast

*You must [Ready](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) this spell in order to do this*.

You choose one creature you can see within range when they cast a spell to negate that spell.

If the [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is [3rd Level Spell](3rd%20Level%20Spells.md) or lower, it is immediately countered.

If the [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is [4th Level Spell](../Level%204/4th%20Level%20Spells.md) or higher, make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 30 [Spellcasting Ability](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) check. On a failure, the spell is not countered.
