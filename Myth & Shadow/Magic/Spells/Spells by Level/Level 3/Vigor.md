You touch a creature and imbue it with magical might.

The creature gains a +5 bonus to their [Strength](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).

When this spell ends, the creature becomes [Exhausted](../../../../Conditions/Exhausted.md).

If you cast this spell on an unwilling target, they make a DC 16 wisdom check to resist this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the strength bonus by 1 and the DC by 2 per spell level*
