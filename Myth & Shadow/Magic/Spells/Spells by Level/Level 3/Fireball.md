You shoot small ball of flame at a target you can see within range.

The ball explodes, affecting everything [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the target.

Affected targets take 4d6 [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.

If the target is an [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md), or flammable object, it starts [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) with [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md).

*[Equipment](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Equipment.md) does not count as an object*.
