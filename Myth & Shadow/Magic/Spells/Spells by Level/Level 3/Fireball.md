You shoot small ball of flame at a target you can see within range.

The ball explodes, affecting everything [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the target.

Affected targets take 5d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.

If the target is an [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md), or flammable object, it starts [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) â€” [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md).

*[Equipment](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md) / [Stash](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md) do not count as objects*.
