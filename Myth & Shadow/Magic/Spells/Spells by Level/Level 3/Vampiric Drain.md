You drain the lifeforce of a creature you can see within range.

The affected creature takes 2d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and you regain that much [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md).

You cease being [Wounded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md) and [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) when you regain [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) this way.
