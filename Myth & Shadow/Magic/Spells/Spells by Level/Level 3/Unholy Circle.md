You desecrate the area around you. Create a 10 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you that moves with you for the duration.

Creatures take 2d6 [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage if they enter the aura unless they are [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md), [Unholy](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Unholy%20Creature.md) or you choose to let them enter freely.
