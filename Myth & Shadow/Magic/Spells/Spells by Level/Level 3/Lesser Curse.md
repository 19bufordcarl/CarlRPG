You touch a creature and curse their very soul for the duration.

Propose some curse. The affected creature chooses whether to suffer the effect you proposed or be [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md). This exhaustion is not removed by [Resting](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md).

The affected creature may use their [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell. They may only make this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) once. A PC may repeat this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) over [Downtime](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).

After casting this spell, you become [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
- *4th level (Curse): No additional benefit.*
- *5th level (Greater Curse): If the creature refuses the effect, they are [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) instead.*
