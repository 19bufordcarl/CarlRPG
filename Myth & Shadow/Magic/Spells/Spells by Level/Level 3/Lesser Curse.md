You touch one creature speaking the incantation to curse their very soul with necrotic energy.

Propose some curse. The affected creature chooses whether to suffer the effect you proposed or be [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) for the duration. This exhaustion is not removed by [Resting](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md).

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 5 or higher, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

## FAQ

Creatures typically only have HP for ease of accounting, so exhaustion simply means that they will fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md) when they take any damage.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
- *4th level (Curse): No additional benefit.*
- *5th level (Greater Curse): If the creature refuses the effect, they are [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) instead.*
