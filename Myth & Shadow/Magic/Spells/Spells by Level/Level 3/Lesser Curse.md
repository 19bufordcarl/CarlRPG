You touch a creature and curse their very soul for the duration.

Propose some curse. The affected creature chooses whether to suffer the effect you proposed or be [Wounded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md). This can only be cured by a [Lesser Restoration](Lesser%20Restoration.md) of at least this [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md).

The affected creature may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
- *4th level (Curse): No additional benefit.*
- *5th level (Greater Curse): If the creature refuses the effect, they are [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) instead.*
