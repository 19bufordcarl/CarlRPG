You sunder the ground itself, causing stones to erupt. Choose any number of targets who are [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

Affected targets take 3d8 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md). If the target is a creature, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 and deal an additional 1d8 damage per spell level*.
