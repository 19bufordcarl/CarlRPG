You sunder the ground itself, causing stones to erupt. Choose any number of targets who are [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

Affected targets take 3d8 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Blunt](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage. If the target is a creature, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 and deal an additional 1d8 damage per spell level*.
