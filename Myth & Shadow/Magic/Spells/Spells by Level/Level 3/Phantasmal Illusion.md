You create a powerful audio-visual illusion. It can be no bigger than a dragon.

Any creature who can see the illusion aura is considered affected by it.

Affected creatures choose whether to suffer an effect you propose or be [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) with fear. They may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

If any of the affected creatures use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) the illusion, the spell immediately ends.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
