You create a powerful audio-visual illusion. It must fit inside a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md).

Any creature who can see the illusion aura is considered affected by it.

Any affected creature chooses whether to suffer an effect you proposed or be frozen with fear and be [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md).

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 3 or higher, they can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to resist this spell.

If any of the affected creatures touch the illusion, the spell immediately ends.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
