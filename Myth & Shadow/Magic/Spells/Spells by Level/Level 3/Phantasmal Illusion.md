You create a powerful audio-visual illusion. It can be no bigger than a dragon.

Any creature who can see the illusion aura is considered affected by it.

Affected creatures choose whether to suffer an effect you propose or be [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) with fear. They may use their [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.

If any of the affected creatures use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) the illusion, the spell immediately ends.
