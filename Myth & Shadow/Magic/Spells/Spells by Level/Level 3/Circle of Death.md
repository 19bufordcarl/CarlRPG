You desecrate the area around you. Create a 10 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you that moves with you for the duration.

Affected creatures take 2d6 [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage unless you choose to let them enter freely. A creature only takes this damage once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).
