You desecrate the area around you. Create a 10 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you that moves with you for the duration.

Creatures take 2d6 [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage if they are in the aura unless they are [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) or a [Demon](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Demon.md) or you choose to let them enter freely. A creature only takes this damage once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md), even if the leave the aura and then re-enter it.
