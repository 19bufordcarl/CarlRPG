You conjure a tidal wave of cold water around you, affecting all creatures [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

Affected targets take 3d6 [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage and become [Wet](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wet.md) until the end of their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

Any flames within the wave are doused.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level*
