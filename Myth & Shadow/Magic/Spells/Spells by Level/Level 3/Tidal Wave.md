You conjure a tidal wave of cold water from your palms.

Create an [Area](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Area.md) in front of you that is 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 10 feet tall.

Affected targets take 3d6 [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage and become [Wet](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wet.md) until the end of their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

Douse any exposed flames in the affected area.
