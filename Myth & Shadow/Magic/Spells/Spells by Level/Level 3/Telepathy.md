# Telepathy

| Level    | [3rd Level Spell](3rd%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 hex                                                                 |
| Domains  | [Air](../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)                                   |

You can communicate telepathically with any creatures within range for the duration. You don't need to share any [Languages](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/The%20People%20of%20Mithrinia/Languages/Languages.md) to share thoughts.

This communication is vulnerable to scrying.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 1 hex per spell level.*
