You conjure of cloud of foul smelling awfulness around you for the duration.

When an [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) or [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) becomes [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md) and are [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) until the end of their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md)

An affected creature may repeat this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) at the end of their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). If they are removed from the cloud or the cloud is dispelled, they stop *coughing* immediately. Once they succeed on this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md), they cannot be affected by this spell again.
