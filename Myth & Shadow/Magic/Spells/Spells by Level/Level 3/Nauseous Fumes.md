You conjure of cloud of foul smelling awfulness. Create a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on a point you can see within range.

Affected creatures must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check or start *coughing* violently. While *coughing* they fall [Prone](../../../../Conditions/Prone.md) and are [Incapacitated](../../../../Conditions/Incapacitated.md). They repeat this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) at the end of each [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). If they are removed from the cloud or the cloud is dispelled, they stop *coughing* immediately.

Undead are immune to this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
