You conjure of cloud of foul smelling awfulness around you for the duration.

Whenever a [Beast](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Beast.md) or [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) becomes [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) until the end of their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

If they are removed from the cloud or the cloud is dispelled, they cease being [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md) immediately. A creature can only be affected by this once per [Combat](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md).

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
