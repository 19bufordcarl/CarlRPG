You create a small sphere of magically compressed ice for the duration.

As part of casting the spell or as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) on a following [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you may throw the sphere up to 30 feet at a target you can see or use it as a [Sling Stone](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md).

When the sphere is broken, or the spell ends, it explodes in a freezing blast affecting the target and all creatures [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the target.

Affected targets take 3d8 [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage.

*You may give this sphere to another creature to use.*

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d8 damage per spell level*
