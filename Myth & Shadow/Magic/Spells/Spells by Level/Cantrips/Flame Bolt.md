| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled                                                       |

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame acts like a heatless [Torch](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Torch%20Kit.md). The spell ends if you cast it again.

When you cast this spell, you can choose to immediately hurl the flame at a target you can see within range. You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 1d10 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) damage. Any non-worn flammable items are set on fire.

Until the spell ends, you can take an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to hurl the flame at a target within range.
