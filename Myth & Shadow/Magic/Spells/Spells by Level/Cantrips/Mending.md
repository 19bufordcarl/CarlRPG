This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.

---
*Upgrade: The break can be 1 foot bigger per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency bonus above 2.*
