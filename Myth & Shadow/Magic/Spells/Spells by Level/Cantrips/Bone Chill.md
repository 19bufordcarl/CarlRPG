You channel the chill of death into the bones of one target you can see within range.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, affected targets take 1d10 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and cannot regain [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

*Upgrade: Deal 1d10 additional damage per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
