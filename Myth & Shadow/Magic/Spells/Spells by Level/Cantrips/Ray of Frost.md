You shoot a beam of frost energy at a target you can see within range.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 1d8 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage. If the target is standing on the ground, they fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md).

*Upgrade: Deal 1d8 additional damage per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency bonus above 2.*
