You touch a target with lightning crackling between your fingers.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 1d12 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and cannot [Opportunity Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Opportunity%20Attack.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

---
*Upgrade: Deal 1d12 additional damage per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
