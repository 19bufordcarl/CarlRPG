# Minor Illusion

| Level    | [Cantrip]({Cantrips}.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until Dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration or otherwise dispelled via inspection. See the descriptions below for the effects of each.

Physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

To otherwise discern that this is an illusion, a creature can make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Save%20DC.md) once per suspicious activity you perform per the GM's discretion.

**_Sound._** If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

**_Image._** If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a medium sized creature. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect.

_Upgrade: The range increases by 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1._
