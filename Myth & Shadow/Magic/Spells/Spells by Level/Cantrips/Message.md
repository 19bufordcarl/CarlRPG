You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical [Silence](../Level%202/Silence.md); 1 foot of stone, wood, other lighter materials; or a thin sheet of heavy metal blocks the spell.

*Upgrade: The range increases by 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per [Cantrip Upgrade](../../Cantrip%20Upgrade.md).*
