You launch a mote of starlight at a target you can see within range, attempting to mark it.

The affected target makes a [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Saving Throw](../../../Spellcasting/Saving%20Throw.md) or takes 1d8 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage, acts as a heatless [Torch](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Torch%20Kit.md), and cannot become [Invisible](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Invisible.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

*Upgrade: Deal 1d8 additional damage per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
