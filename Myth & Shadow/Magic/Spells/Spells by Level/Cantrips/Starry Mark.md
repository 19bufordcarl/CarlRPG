You launch a mote of starlight at a target you can see within range, attempting to mark it.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 1d8 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage. The target also becomes illuminated like a heatless [Torch](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Torch%20Kit.md) and cannot become [Invisible](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Invisible.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
