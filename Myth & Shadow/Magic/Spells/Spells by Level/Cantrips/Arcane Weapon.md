A [Weapon](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) you are holding is imbued with arcane power. When you cast this spell, you may choose to immediately make a [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) if you are able to.

For the duration, you can use your [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) instead of [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) for the attack and damage rolls of any [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8.

If the attack deals damage, it can be [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Blunt](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) or [Edged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Edged.md) damage or the weapon's normal [Damage Type](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) (your choice).

The spell is dispelled if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

---
*Upgrade: The damage die increase by 1 step per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency tier above 1.*
