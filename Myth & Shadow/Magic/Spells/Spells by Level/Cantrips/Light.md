You conjure a magical light above your head. It illuminates out 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) like a heatless [Torch](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Torch%20Kit.md#Torch).

If you cast this spell again or fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upgrade: It illuminates out 1 additional [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per [Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) proficiency bonus above 2.*
