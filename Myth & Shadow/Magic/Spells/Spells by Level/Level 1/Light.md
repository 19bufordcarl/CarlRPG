| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))                    |
| Range    | Touch                                                                        |

You conjure a magical light. Create a 15 feet [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) on a point you can see within range for the duration. The aura can be centered on a movable object.

The affected area is no longer considered to be in [Darkness](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md).

If you are [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with a creature, you can attempt to blind it by casting light on its eyes. It makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, it is [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) until the end of its next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*

*Note: Higher level light spells defeat higher level [Darkness](../Level%202/Darkness.md) spells too.*
