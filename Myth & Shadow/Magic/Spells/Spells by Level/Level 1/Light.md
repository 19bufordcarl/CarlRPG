| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md)        |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))                    |
| Range    | Touch                                                                        |
| Domains  | [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md), [Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md) |

You imbue an object with a brilliant, heatless light equivalent to a [Torch](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/1%20Coin/Torch.md) for the duration.

If you are within 5' of a creature, you can attempt to blind it by casting light on it's eyes. It makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) check. On a failure, it is [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) until the end of its next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level. Additionally, the light defeats higher level [Darkness](../Level%202/Darkness.md) spells at higher levels.*
