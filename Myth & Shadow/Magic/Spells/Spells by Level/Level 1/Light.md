| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | 1 hour                                              |
| Range    | Touch                                               |
| Domains  | [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)            |

You imbue an object with a brilliant, heatless light equivalent to a [Torch](../../../../Items/Gear/1%20Coin/Torch.md) for the duration.
*1 hour is equivalent to 6 [Delving](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md) turns.*

Alternatively, if you are within 5' of a creature, you can attempt to blind it by casting light on it's eyes. It may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, it is [Blinded](../../../../Conditions/Blinded.md) until the end of its next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level. Additionally, the light defeats higher level [Darkness](../Level%202/Darkness.md) spells at higher levels.*
