# Disguise Self

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |

You make yourselfâ€”including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing. Doing so immediately makes them aware that this is a spell.

To otherwise discern that you are disguised, a creature can make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../Spell%20Save%20DC.md) once per suspicious activity you perform per the GM's discretion.

*Upcast: You disguise is slightly more convincing per spell level.*
