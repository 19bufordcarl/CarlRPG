You touch a weapon and imbue it with energy. That weapon deals [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and grants an additional +1 to attack [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) and [Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) rolls for the duration.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: At 3rd level it grants +2. At 5th level +3.*
