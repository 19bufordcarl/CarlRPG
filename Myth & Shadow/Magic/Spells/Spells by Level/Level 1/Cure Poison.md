You use life energy to neutralize a poison on a creature you touch.

The affected creature is cured of [Poisoned 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Poisoned.md).

*This does not reduce X for poisons with a higher X, it simply does nothing.*

---
*Upcast: Increase the curable value of X by 1 per spell level.*
