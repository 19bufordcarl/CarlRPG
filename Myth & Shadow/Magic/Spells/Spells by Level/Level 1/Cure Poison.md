You use life energy to neutralize a poison on a creature you touch.

The affected creature is cured of [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Poisoned X](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Poisoned.md).

*This does not do anything for higher tier poisons.*

---
*Upcast: Increase the tier of curable poison by 1 per every 2 spell levels.*
