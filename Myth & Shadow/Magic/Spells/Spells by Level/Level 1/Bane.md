| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You attempt to curse up to 3 creatures you can see within range for the duration.

You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, affected targets are *baned*.

Roll 1d4 once. Whenever a *baned* creature makes any [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md), they subtract the rolled value.

---
*Upcast: Target 1 additional creature per spell level.*
