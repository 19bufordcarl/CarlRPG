You perform a ritual to let you form a special bond with one of your [Trained Animals](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/Trained%20Animals.md) to have it become your familiar. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.

**_Telepathic Connection._** While your familiar is within 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, when you close your eyes, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.

Finally, when you cast a [Spell](../../../Spells.md) with a [Spell Range](../../Spell%20Attributes.md#Spell%20Range) of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) of you, and it must take a [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.

**_Combat._** The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It acts on its own [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in [Initiative](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Initiative.md).

**_Disappearance of the Familiar._** When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it starts [Dying](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md) like a PC would. Its [Max Scar Threshold](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Scars.md#Max%20Scar%20Threshold) is equal to 5.

**_One Familiar Only._** You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you must break the bond with your old familiar before bonding to the new one.
