# Detect Magic

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You gain the ability to detect the presence of magic and [Extraplanars](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) within range for the duration.

You can discern the basic characteristics of a one magical source per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md). If it is related to a [Spell](../../../Spells.md) that you have heard of before, you know which spell (does not require this is a [Known Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md)).

If you focus on this for an entire [Break](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md), you can *Identify* a magic item.

Thick barriers of metal or stone obstruct this spell.

## Identify

You touch an object throughout the spell's casting. If the object is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires Attunement, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any ongoing [Spells](../../../Spells.md) are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell's name.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
