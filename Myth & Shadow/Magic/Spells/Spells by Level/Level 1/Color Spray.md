You launch a dazzling array of flashing, colorful light at up to two targets you can see within range.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, affected targets are [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
