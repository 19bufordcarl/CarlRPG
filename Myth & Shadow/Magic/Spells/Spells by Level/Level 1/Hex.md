# Hex

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md)    |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))         |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) |

You place a simple curse on a creature you can see within range for the duration.

Once per [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) when you deal damage to the affected creature, you may have them take 1d6 additional [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.

Choose [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md), [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md), or [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md). Any [Critical Success](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) made with the chosen ability instead counts as a [Critical Failure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).

---
*Upcast: If cast at level 3 or higher, it does not require [Concentration](../../Concentration.md).*
