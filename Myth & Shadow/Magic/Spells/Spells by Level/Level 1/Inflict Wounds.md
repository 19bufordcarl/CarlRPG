You drain the lifeforce of creature you touch.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 2d12 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage or [Half](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) as much damage on a failure.
