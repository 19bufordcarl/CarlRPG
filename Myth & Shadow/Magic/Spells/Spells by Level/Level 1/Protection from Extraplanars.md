Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against [Extraplanar](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) creatures.

The protection grants several benefits. Any [Extraplanar](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) has [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on any [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or suffer similar conditions from them. If the target is already possessed or otherwise afflicted by such a creature, you learn of the affliction. If this spell was cast at a sufficiently high [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) to have a chance to dispel the affliction, you may make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the [Extraplanar's](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md) to end the affliction.
