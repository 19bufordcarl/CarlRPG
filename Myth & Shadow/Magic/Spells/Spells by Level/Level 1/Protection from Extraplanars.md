| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | Touch                                                                 |

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against [Extraplanar](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) creatures.

The protection grants several benefits. Any [Extraplanar](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) has [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on any [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or suffer similar conditions from them. If the target is already possessed or otherwise afflicted by such a creature, you learn of the affliction. If this spell was cast at a sufficiently high [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) to have a chance to dispel the affliction, you may make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the [Extraplanar's](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md) to end it.
