You redirect life energy into a creature restoring 1d4 [Health Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) (HP).

Alternatively, you may ritually cast this spell over a [Delve Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to fully restore the [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) of a creature. You automatically succeed [The Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) if do so. If you take *any* damage while ritually casting this spell, you suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).

*Any healing beyond max HP rolls over to the creature's [Fatigue Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md).* *This spell can only heal mortal creatures. This spell does not heal [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).*

---
*Upcast: Restore an additional 1 HP per spell level.*
