| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md)          |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))                      |
| Range    | Touch                                                                          |

You direct raw lifeforce into a creature you touch for the duration.

At the end of your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), the touched creature restores 1d6 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) and is no longer [Wounded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

This spell only lasts while you are touching the affected creature.

*This spell does not heal [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).*

---
*Upcast: Restore an additional 1d6 HP per spell level.*
