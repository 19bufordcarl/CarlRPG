You direct raw lifeforce into a creature you touch.

The affected creature restores 2d12 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) and cease being [Wounded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

When you cease touching the affected creature, the spell ends.
