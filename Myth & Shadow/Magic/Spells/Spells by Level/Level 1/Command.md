# Command

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | None                                                                  |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range.

You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target must follow the command on its next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). The command can be one of these options:

**Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) if it becomes [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

**Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

**Flee.** The target spends its [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**Grovel.** The target drops [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md) and then ends its [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

**Halt.** On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md), or [Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md).

**Improvise.** Choose another word to be interpreted at the GMs discretion! If this command would obviously cause the creature to lose [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md), it fails.
