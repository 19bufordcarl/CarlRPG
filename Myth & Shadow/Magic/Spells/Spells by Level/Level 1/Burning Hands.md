You unleash a gout of flames from your hands at up to two targets you can see within range.

Affected targets take 2d6 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.

If the target is a [Beast](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Beast.md), [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md), or flammable object, it starts [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) â€” [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md).

*[Equipment](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md) / [Stash](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md) does not count as an object*.
