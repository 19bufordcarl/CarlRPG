You unleash a gout of flames from your hands at up to two targets you can see within range.

You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md).
