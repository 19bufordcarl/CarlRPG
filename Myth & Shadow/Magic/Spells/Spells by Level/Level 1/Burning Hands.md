You unleash a gout of flames from your hands at up to two targets you can see within range.

On a success, affected targets take 3d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage or [Half](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) as much damage on a failure.

Regardless, targets that are [Beasts](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Beast.md), [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md), or flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) — [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md).
