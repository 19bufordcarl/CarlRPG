You surround yourself with a poisonous spray, affecting all creatures [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

Affected creatures take 1d4 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Poisoned 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Poisoned.md).

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
