You breathe out and create a toxic cloud. Create a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you, affecting all creatures except you.

Affected creatures take d4 [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check. On a failure, that creature gains [Poisoned 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Poisoned.md).

---
*Upcast: Deal an additional d4 damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
