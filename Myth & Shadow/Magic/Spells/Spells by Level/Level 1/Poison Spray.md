You breathe out and create a toxic cloud. Create a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you and affecting all creatures except you.

Affected creatures take 1d4 [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check. On a failure, that creature gains [Poisoned 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Poisoned.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the damage by 1d4 and DC by 2 per spell level.*
