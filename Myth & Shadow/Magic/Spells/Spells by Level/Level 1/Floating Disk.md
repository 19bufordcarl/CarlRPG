You conjure a circular disk of force that acts as a [Stash](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md) capable of holding anything up to the size of a bed for the duration.

The disk floats around just above the ground at all times.

The disk must remain within range at all times.

The spell ends if the disk is ever in an extended free fall.

*Upcast: Can hold larger items in the stash appropriate to the spell level*
