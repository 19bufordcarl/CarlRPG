You conjure a circular disk of force that acts as a [Stash](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md) capable of holding anything up to the size of a bed for the duration.

The disk floats around 3~5 feet above the ground at all times.

The disk must remain within range at all times.

The disk cannot traverse sudden elevation changes larger than 10 feet; the spell ends if the disk is in free fall for more than 5 feet.

*Upcast: Can hold larger items in the stash appropriate to the spell level*
