You hurl a bolt of light toward a creature you can see within range.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 4d6 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage and the next [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) against it has [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) as it glows.
