You can touch one target, or designate an [Area](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Area.md) that is roughly a 30 foot cube.

If a creature enters the area or touches the target, then a magical alarm with a noise of your choosing goes off in your head. The spell then ends.

You can choose creatures for this alarm to ignore as part of the casting.
