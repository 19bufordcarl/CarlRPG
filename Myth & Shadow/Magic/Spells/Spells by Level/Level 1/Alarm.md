You can touch one target.

When a creature becomes [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the target, a magical alarm with a noise of your choosing goes off in your head or at the target's location, your choice when you cast this spell. This alarm lasts for several seconds and awakens you if you are asleep. The spell then ends.

You can choose creatures for this alarm to ignore as part of the casting.
