You cover the ground of 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) you can see within range with super slick ice.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, affected targets fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md) immediately.

Whenever a creature enters the [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md), it must make a [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Finesse](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Finesse.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../Spell%20Save%20DC.md) or fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md) and end its [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) immediately.

The ice melts after an appropriate amount of time given the temperature of the [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).
