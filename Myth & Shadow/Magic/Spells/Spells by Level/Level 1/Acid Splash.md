You conjure a bubble of caustic brine and hurl it at a point you can see within range.

The bubble explodes, affecting up to 4 targets who are all [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with each other.

Affected targets take 1d6 [Acid](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage.
