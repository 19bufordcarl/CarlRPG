| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | Touch                                                                 |

You ward a creature you touch for the duration.

Any creature who targets the warded creature with an [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) or [Spell](../../../Spells.md) must first succeed on a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../Spell%20Save%20DC.md) if the warded creature so chooses.

On a failure, the attack or spell does nothing. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from areas of effect. The spell ends if the warded creature makes an [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) or [Casts a Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Cast%20a%20Spell).
