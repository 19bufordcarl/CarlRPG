You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast affecting all targets that are [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the targets' [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, affected targets take 2d8 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Blunt](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage and are pushed back far enough to no longer be [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

The blast is audible for hundreds of feet.
