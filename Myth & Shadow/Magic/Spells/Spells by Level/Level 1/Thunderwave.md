You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast. This concussive wave of magical force deals 1d6 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) to creatures within 5 feet of you. Each creature must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, the creature is pushed back 10 feet.

Any unsecured objects are flung backwards. The thunderous clap is audible for around 300 feet.

---
*Upcast: Deal 1d6 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
