You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast affecting all targets that are [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you.

Affected targets take 1d6 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage and make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are pushed back far enough to no longer be [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the caster.

The blast is audible for hundreds of feet.

*Upcast: Deal 1d6 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
