You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast audible out to 300 feet. Create a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you and affecting all creatures except you.

Affected targets take 1d6 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check. On a failure, the target is pushed back 10 feet.

*Objects usually automatically fail checks*

---
*Upcast: Deal 1d6 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
