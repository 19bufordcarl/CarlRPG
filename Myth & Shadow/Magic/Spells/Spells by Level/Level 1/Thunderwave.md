You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast audible out to 300 feet. Create a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you, affecting all creatures except you.

Affected targets take 1d6 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are pushed back 10 feet.

*Objects automatically fail this check*

---
*Upcast: Deal 1d6 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
