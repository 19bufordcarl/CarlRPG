You touch a weapon and imbue it with unstable arcane energy for the duration.

When you roll the damage die for that weapon, roll two damage die instead. Double the lower die's value and treat that as the result of the damage die. Additionally, that weapon deals [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) for the duration.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: At 3rd level it grants +1 to damage **after** doubling too. At 5th level this is +2.*
