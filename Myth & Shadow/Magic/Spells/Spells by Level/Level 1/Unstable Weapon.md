You touch a weapon and imbue it with unstable arcane energy for the duration.

The damage die for the weapon is altered as follows:

1. Roll double the damage die.
2. Select the lower result for the damage die.
3. Double the lower result and treat that as the result of the damage die.
4. Add any relevant bonuses to get the final damage dealt.
5. Treat the [Damage Type](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) for this weapon as [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
