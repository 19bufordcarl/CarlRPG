You touch a weapon and imbue it with unstable arcane energy for the duration.

The damage the affected weapon deals is altered as follows:

1. Roll the damage die with [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md), but then double it.
2. Add any relevant bonuses to get the final damage dealt.
3. Treat the [Damage Type](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) for this weapon as [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: You may target one additional weapon per spell level.*
