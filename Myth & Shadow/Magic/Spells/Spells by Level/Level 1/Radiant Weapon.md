You touch a weapon and imbue it with radiant energy for the duration.

The weapon does an additional 1d4 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage on any [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) you make with it.

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), attempt to recast this spell, or cease touching the weapon, the spell ends.

*Upcast: Increase the damage die by 1 step per spell level (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12).*
