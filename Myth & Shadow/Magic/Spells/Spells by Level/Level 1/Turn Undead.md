# Turn Undead

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You sanctify the area around you, affected all [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) within range for the duration.

Any affected [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) whose [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) is less than this [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) are destroyed.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against all stronger affected [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md)'s [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, they are [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) and [Deafened](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deafened.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), and become immune to this instance of this spell.
