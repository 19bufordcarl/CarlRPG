You sanctify the area around you. Create a 30 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you for the duration.

Any affected [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) take 3d12 [Holy](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Holy.md) damage if they end their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) in the aura or if they use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) while in the aura.

- If the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than or equal to this [Spell's Level](../../Spell%20Level.md), the aura destroys it instantly.
- If the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is greater than your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), it makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check to resist this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
