You draw on surrounding magical energies to bolster any willing [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) that are holding hands in a circle. They each increase their [Max HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md#Max%20HP) by 1.

If another effect would increase an affected creature's [Max HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md#Max%20HP), only the stronger effect is used.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends for all affected creatures.

---
*Upcast: Increase Max HP by an additional 1 per spell level.*
