You draw on surrounding magical energies to bolster any number of [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) that are holding hands in a circle for the duration.

Affected creatures increase their [Max HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md#Max%20HP) by 2.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends for all affected creatures.
