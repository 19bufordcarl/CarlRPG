You draw on surrounding magical energies to bolster any willing [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) that are holding hands in a circle. They increase their max [Fatigue Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) (FP) by 1.

If another effect would increase an affected creature's max FP, this spell ends for them.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends for everyone affected.

---
*Upcast: Increase max FP by an additional 1 per spell level.*
