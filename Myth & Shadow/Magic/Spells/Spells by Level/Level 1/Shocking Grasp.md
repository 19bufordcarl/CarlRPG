You touch a target with lightning crackling between your fingers.

The affected target takes 1d8 [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and is [Dazed](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dazed.md) until your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

*Upcast: Deal 1d8 additional damage per spell level.*
