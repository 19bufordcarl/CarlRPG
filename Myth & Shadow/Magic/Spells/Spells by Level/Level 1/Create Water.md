You conjure up to 10 gallons of purified water within range, filling an open container of your choice.

Alternatively, you can summon rain in a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) at a point you can see in range, dousing any exposed flames in the vicinity.

Affected targets become [Wet](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wet.md). They dry off at the *end* of the *next* [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

---
*Upcast: Create another 10 gallons or increase the aura by 5 feet per spell level*.
