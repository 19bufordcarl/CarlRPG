You conjure up to 10 gallons of clean water within range, filling an open container if you choose.

Alternatively, you can summon rain in a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) at a point you can see in range, dousing any exposed flames in the affected area.

Affected targets become [Wet](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wet.md) until the end of their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

---
*Upcast: Create another 10 gallons or increase the aura by 5 feet per spell level*.
