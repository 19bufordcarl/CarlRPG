You conjure up to 10 gallons of clean water within range, filling an open container if you choose.

Alternatively, you can summon rain over a [Medium](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Sizes) creature you can see within range.

Affected targets become [Wet](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wet.md) until the end of their next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

Any flames where you create the water are doused.

---
*Upcast: Create another 10 gallons per spell level*.

*This lets you target the next larger sized creature, or 1 additional creature of the same size.*
