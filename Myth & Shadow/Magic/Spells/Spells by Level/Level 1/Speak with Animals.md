You gain the ability to converse with [Animals](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) for the duration.

They use their normal intelligence level, but they can give at least rudimentary information and directions about the local environment, predators, and monsters.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
