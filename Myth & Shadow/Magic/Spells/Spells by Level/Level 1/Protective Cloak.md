When a creature makes a [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) against you, you may cast this spell.

Choose [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md), [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md), [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md), or [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md). You can only choose options for which one of your [Known Cantrips](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Cantrips.md) is capable of dealing that [Damage Type](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md). You are surrounded by the magic of the associated type that retaliates against those who would do you harm.

This *Protective Cloak* has 5 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md). Whenever you are hit with a [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md), the cloak absorbs any damage dealt from that attack first. Any excess damage is dealt to your [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md). Whenever a creature deals damage to the cloak, they take 5 [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) damage in retaliation.

When the cloak is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) or you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), this spell ends.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends.

---
*Upcast: Increase the cloak's HP and damage dealt by 5 per spell level.*
