You magically induce slumber for the duration.

You select a number of creatures you can see within range whose total [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) is 2 or less.

Affected creatures fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md).

Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up and ends this spell for them.

*Upcast: Increase the total [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) by 1 per spell level.*
