You can select up to 2 creatures within range. Those creatures fall asleep if they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 2 or lower. They are [Unconscious](../../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) for the duration. Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up.
