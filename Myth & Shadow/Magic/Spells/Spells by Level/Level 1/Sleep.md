You magically induce slumber for the duration.

You select a number of creatures whose total [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is 2 or less within range.

Affected creatures fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md). Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up.

*Upcast: Increase the total [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) by 1 per spell level.*
