| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |

You magically induce slumber for the duration.

Choose any number of creatures [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with one another that you can see within range. You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, affected [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) and [Beasts](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Beast.md) fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md). Other creatures are [Dazed](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dazed.md) until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up and ends this spell for them.
