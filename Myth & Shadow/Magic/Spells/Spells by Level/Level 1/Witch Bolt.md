| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You create an arcing bolt of lightning between you and a target you can see within range.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 2d12 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and the lightning arcs between you and the target.

So long as the arc of lightning is unobstructed, you may use your [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to deal 1d12 [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage to the target.

If the arc of lightning is ever unobstructed, the spell immediately ends.

*Upcast: Deal 1d12 additional initial damage per spell level.*
