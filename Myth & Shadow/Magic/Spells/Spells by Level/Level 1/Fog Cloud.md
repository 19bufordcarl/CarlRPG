You create a cloud of fog that obscures 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) you can see within range.

Creatures in the [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) are [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md). It also blocks line of sight for [Ranged Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md) and [Spells](../../../Spells.md). It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind disperses it.
