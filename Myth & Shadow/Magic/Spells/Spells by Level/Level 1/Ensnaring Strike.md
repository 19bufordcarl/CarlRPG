| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))      |
| Range    | Self                                                           |

After you hit a target with an [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md), you may cast this spell. Grasping vines appear on the target.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). If the creature is large, you have [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md). On a success, the target is [Restrained](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md) for the duration of the spell.

While the target is [Restrained](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md) by this spell, it takes 1d6 [Edged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Edged.md) damage at the start of its [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). The target or a creature that is [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with it can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to make a [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Finesse](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Finesse.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../Spell%20Save%20DC.md) to break free of the vines, ending the spell.
