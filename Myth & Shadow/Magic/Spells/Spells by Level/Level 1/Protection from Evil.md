| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | 1 hour ([Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md)) |
| Range    | Touch                                               |

While this spell is active, creatures from the [Death](../../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain:

- Have [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) made against the target.
- Are unable to inflict mental [Conditions](../../../../Conditions/!Conditions.md) on the target such as possession.

If the target is already under the influence of possession or a similar condition, the afflicting creature must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). If the creature fails this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), that effect is immediately dispelled.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
