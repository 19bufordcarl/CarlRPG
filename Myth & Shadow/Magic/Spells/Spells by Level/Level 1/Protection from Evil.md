You touch one creature, abjuring it from harmful entities.

For the duration, any hostile creature must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) whenever they target the affected creature.
