| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |

| Range    | Touch                                                                 |

You touch one target, abjuring it from evil entities.

For the duration, [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md), [Demon](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Demon.md), and mons:

- Have [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) made against the target.
- Are unable to inflict mental [Conditions](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md) on the target such as possession.

If the target is already under the influence of possession or a similar condition, the afflicting creature makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). If the creature fails this check, that effect is immediately dispelled.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
