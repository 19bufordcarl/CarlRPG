# Protection from Evil

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | 1 hour ([Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md)) |
| Range    | Touch                                               |
| Domains  | [Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md)            |

For the duration, creatures from the [Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain:

- Have [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) made against the target.
- Are unable to inflict mental [Conditions](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/!Conditions.md) on the target such as possession.

If the target is already under the influence of possession or a similar condition, the afflicting creature must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check. If the creature fails this check, that effect is immediately dispelled.

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
