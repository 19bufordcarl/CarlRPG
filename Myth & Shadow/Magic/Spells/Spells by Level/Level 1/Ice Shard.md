You hurl a shard of ice at a target you can see within range.

You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 1d12 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md) damage. Success or fail, the shard then explodes. Make another [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md) for each creature [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the original target. On a success, they take 2d6 Cold damage.
