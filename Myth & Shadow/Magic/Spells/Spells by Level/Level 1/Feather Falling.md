## FAQ

*The target's max falling speed is set to 120 feet per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) â€” 20 feet per second. This is roughly the speed a human would hit the ground after falling 6 feet. Normally, humans would fall ~580 feet per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) and would hit the ground going ~200 feet per second.*
