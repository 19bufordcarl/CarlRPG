You magically prevent a portal (door, gate, etc.) from opening.

- The [Knock](../Level%202/Knock.md) spell opens the portal immediately, ending this spell.
- Creatures that are 3 or more [Levels](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) higher than your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) can open the portal with an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md).

The portal continues to be held closed even once you are out of range.

*Upcast: Resists higher level knock spells.*
