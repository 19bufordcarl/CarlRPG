# Hold Portal

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 30 feet                                                               |

You magically prevent a "portal" (door, gate, etc.) from opening for the duration.

Creatures can open the portal with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

The portal continues to be held closed even once you are out of range.

The [Knock](../Level%202/Knock.md) spell opens the portal immediately if it is cast at a [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) greater than or equal to this spell. Such a spell immediately ends this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
