# Hold Portal

| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

You magically prevent a "portal" you can see within range from opening for the duration.

*A "portal" is any door, gate, hatch, or similar feature.*

Creatures can open the portal a [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) ([Finesse](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Secondary%20Skills/Finesse.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against your [Spell Save DC](../../Spell%20Save%20DC.md) as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

The portal continues to be held closed even once you are out of range.

The [Knock](../Level%202/Knock.md) spell opens the portal immediately if it is cast at a [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) greater than or equal to this spell. Such a spell immediately ends this spell.

---
*Upcast: Target 1 additional portal per spell level.*
