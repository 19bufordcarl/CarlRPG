You create three glowing bolts of magical energy. Each bolt strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range.

A bolt deals 1d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Blunt](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md) damage to its target. The bolts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
