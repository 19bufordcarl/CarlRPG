| Level    | [1st Level Spell](1st%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | None                                                                  |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind.

You make a [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md)) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target is [Deafened](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deafened.md) and must use its [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to fall [Prone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Prone.md), where it must stay until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). It can take no other [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) or [Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) until then.
