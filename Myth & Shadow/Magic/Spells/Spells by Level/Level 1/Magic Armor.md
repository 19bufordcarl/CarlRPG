You are protected by a magical layer of armor just above your skin for the duration.

If your [Armor Class](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) is less than 13 it becomes 13 plus [Half](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) your [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting your [AC](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) end when you cast this spell.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: Increase the granted AC by 1 per spell level.*
