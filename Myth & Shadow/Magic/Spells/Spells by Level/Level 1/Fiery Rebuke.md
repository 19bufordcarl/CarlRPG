When a creature makes a [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) against you, you may cast this spell.

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 2d12 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage, or [Half](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) as much damage on a failure.
