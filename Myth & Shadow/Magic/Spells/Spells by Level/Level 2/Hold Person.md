You choose 1 target humanoid ([Ancestry](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) you can see within range.

If they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 4 or less, they are [Paralyzed](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for the duration.

If they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 5 or greater, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Abilities/Wisdom.md) check to resist this spell.

They may repeat this check at the *end* of their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).
