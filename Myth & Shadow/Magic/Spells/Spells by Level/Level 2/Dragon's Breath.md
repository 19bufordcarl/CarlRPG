You touch one willing creature, and choose [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md), [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md), [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md), or [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md). You can only choose options for which one of your [Known Cantrips](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Cantrips.md) is capable of dealing that [Damage Type](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).

Until the spell ends, the creature can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to exhale a magical breath attack affecting up to 2 creatures in the same [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) as them. They make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md) using your bonuses. On a success, the target take 3d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) damage of the chosen type or [Half](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) as much damage on a failure.
