You touch one weapon imbuing it with vitalic power for the duration.

The affected weapon deals [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage. When it deals damage an [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) or [Demon](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Demon.md), they start [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) â€” [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
