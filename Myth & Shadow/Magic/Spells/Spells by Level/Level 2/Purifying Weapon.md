You touch one weapon imbuing it with vitalic power for the duration.

The affected weapon deals [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage and sets [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Undead.md) [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) — [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
