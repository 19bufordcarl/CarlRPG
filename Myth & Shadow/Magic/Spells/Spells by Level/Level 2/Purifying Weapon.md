You touch one weapon imbuing it with vitalic power. Damage done with this weapon deals an additional 1d4 [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage. If the target is [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md), double that damage.

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
