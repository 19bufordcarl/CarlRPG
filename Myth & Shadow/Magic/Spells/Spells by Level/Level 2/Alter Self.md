You alter your physical form for the duration.

You gain one physical feature of a [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) or [Beast](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Beast.md). You cannot grow additional limbs, wings, or other appendages.

Alternatively, you can make yourself look just like a [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) you have seen.

*Upcast: You can gain one additional physical feature per spell level.*
