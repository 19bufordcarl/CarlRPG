You alter your physical form, gaining one physical feature of an [Ancestry](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md) or animal for the duration. You cannot grow additional limbs, wings, or other appendages.

Alternatively, you can make yourself look just like a humanoid creature (any [Ancestry](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) you have seen.
