You target one creature you can see within range and subject it to whatever illusion you can imagine for the duration.

The affected creature chooses whether to suffer any effect you propose or be [Incapacitated](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md). They may use their [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.

*The illusion only appears in the mind of the affected creature; it is psionic not visual.*

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
