You can sense the direction and rough distance to an object you specify within range.

You can choose a general object, such as a stairway, to locate the nearest one.

You can choose a specific object if you have seen or studied it in detail.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per spell level.*
