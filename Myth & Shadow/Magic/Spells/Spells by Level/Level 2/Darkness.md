You create a magical darkness within 15 feet of a point you can see within range.

Creatures inside this darkness are [Blinded](../../../../Conditions/Blinded.md).

Only magical light can penetrate this darkness, and only if it came from a spell whose [Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) is greater than or equal to the [Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) used to cast [Darkness](../../../../Hazards/Darkness.md).

The target of the sphere can be a point, or an object.
