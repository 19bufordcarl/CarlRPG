You conjure a magical darkness. Create a 15 feet [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) on a point you can see within range for the duration. The aura can be centered on a movable object.

Affected creatures are [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) unless they have [Darkvision](Darkvision.md) or similar.

Only magical [Light](../Level%201/Light.md) can penetrate this darkness and only if its [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) is greater than or equal to the [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) used to cast [Darkness](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md).
