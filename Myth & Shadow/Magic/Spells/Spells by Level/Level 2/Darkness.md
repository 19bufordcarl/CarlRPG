You conjure a magical darkness. Create a 15 feet [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) on a point you can see within range.

Affected creatures are [Blinded](../../../../Conditions/Blinded.md).

Only magical light can penetrate this darkness, and only if it came from a spell whose [Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) is greater than or equal to the [Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) used to cast [Darkness](../../../../Hazards/Darkness.md).

The target of the sphere can be a point, or an object.
