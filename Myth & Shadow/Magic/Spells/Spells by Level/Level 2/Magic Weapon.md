You touch a weapon and imbue it with energy for the duration.

Choose an [Energy](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md#Energy) damage type for which you have another [Known Spell](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md) capable of dealing that damage type. The affected weapon now deals damage of that type for its [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: Increase the weapon's attack and damage rolls by 1 per 2 spell levels.*
