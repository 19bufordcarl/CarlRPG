You touch one weapon, giving it ability to hone in on a target's weakness for the duration.

The affected weapon deals [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and rolls its damage die with [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

---
*Upcast: Increase the weapon's attack and damage rolls by 1 per 2 spell levels.*
