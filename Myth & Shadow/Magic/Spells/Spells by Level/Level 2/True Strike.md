You touch one weapon, giving it ability to hone in on a target's weakness for the duration.

The affected weapon deals [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and gains the [Deadly Property](../../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapon%20Properties/Deadly%20Property.md).

Any other [Spells](../../../Spells.md) affecting this weapon end when this spell is cast on it.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: You may target one additional weapon per spell level.*
