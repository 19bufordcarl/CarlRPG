You touch one weapon imbuing it with holy power. Damage done with this weapon deals an additional 1d4 [Holy](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Holy.md) damage and double that to [Undead](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Undead.md).

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.

*Upcast: The damage increases by 1 per spell level.*
