You conjure a cloud of bright purplish pink magical dust. Create a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) on a point you can see within range for the duration.

This dust reveals all invisible targets in the area, as well as granting [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) against affected targets. These effects apply even after the creature leaves the aura.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' and the radius by 5' per spell level.*
