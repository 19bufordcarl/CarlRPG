A corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see within in range.
 
You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target takes 3d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage and takes another 2d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage at the end of its next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md). On a failure, the target takes [Half](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) as much initial damage only.
