A corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see within in range.

The affected target takes 2d6 [Acid](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage and starts [Burning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Burning.md) â€” [Acid](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Acid.md).
