A corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see within in range.

The affected target takes 2d6 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and has their [AC](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) reduced by 2 until the end of your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage per spell level.*
