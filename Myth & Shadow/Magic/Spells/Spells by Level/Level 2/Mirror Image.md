You create illusory image that look exactly like you for the duration.

You can create up to 2 images. Whenever you would be dealt damage, one of the images takes the damage instead, and then dissipates.

The spell ends when all the images are gone.

---
*Upcast: Create 1 additional image per spell level.*
