Lightning energy shoots out from your fingertips. The bolt connects to one target of your choice in range and an arc of lightning connects you to them.

The affected target takes d6 [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage immediately and at the start of your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) for the duration.

If the arc becomes totally blocked or longer than 30 feet, the spell ends.

---
*Upcast: Deal an additional d6 damage per spell level.*
