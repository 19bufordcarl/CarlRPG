Lightning energy shoots out from your fingertips. The bolt connects to one target within range and an arc of lightning connects you to them for the duration.

You may use your [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to have the affected target take 1d6 [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage.

If the arc's path becomes obstructed or longer than 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md), the spell ends.

---
*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage per spell level.*
