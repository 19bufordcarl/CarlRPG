You draw on surrounding magical energies to bolster any number of [Humanoids](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) that are holding hands in a circle for the duration.

Affected creatures increase their [Current HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md#Current%20HP) by 5 for the duration. This increase may allow them to exceed their [Max HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md#Max%20HP) threshold by up to 5 at time of the spell being cast.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends for all affected creatures.

---
*Upcast: Increase Current HP and threshold by an additional 5 per spell level.*
