You summon a minor [Extraplanar](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Extraplanar.md) spirit and bind it to a weapon you conjure in your hand.

Choose [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md), [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Fire.md), [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md), or [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md). You can only choose options for which one of your [Known Cantrips](../../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Cantrips.md) is capable of dealing that [Damage Type](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md).

Until the spell ends, you can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to make a [Melee Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) with this weapon but use [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) ([Arcana](../../../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md)) to determine your bonuses for this attack. On a hit, the weapon deals 3d6 [Tier 2](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) damage of the chosen type plus your [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md).
