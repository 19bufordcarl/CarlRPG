# Detect Thoughts

| Level    | [2nd Level Spell](2nd%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 30 feet                                                               |
| Domains  | [Water](../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md)                               |

You gain the ability to peer into the mind of creatures you can see within range for the duration.

Each [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Round) you can learn one target's immediate thoughts. The target then makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) check. On a success, the target notices your intrusion, and the spell ends.

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level. Additionally, the GM can give you deeper level thoughts appropriate to the higher spell level.*
