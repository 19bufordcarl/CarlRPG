# Censure

| Level    | [2nd Level Spell](2nd%20Level%20Spells.md)                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md)      |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))                  |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)          |

You magically censor one creature you can see within range for the duration.

Choose one of [Blinded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Blinded.md) or [Deafened](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deafened.md).

You make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a success, the target is afflicted with the chosen condition. You must repeat this [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) at the start of each of your following [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) if you wish to keep the spell going. On a failure, the spell ends.
