For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you touch (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, you must make a [Spellcasting Check](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target's [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Spell Resist DC](../../Spell%20Resist%20DC.md). On a failure, the spell has no effect.

Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.

**_Enlarge._** The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). The target's [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

**_Reduce._** The target's size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). The target's [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal 1d4 less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

---
_Upcast: Increase the additional damage die size by one step per spell level._
