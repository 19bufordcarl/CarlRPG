You compel one creature you can see within range to tell the truth for the duration.

They may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.
