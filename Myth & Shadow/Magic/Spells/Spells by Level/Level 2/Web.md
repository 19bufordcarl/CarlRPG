You create a sticky web. Create a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) on a point you can see within range.

Affected creatures make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) check. On a failure, they are [Restrained](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md). They may then use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to slip free of the web.

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
