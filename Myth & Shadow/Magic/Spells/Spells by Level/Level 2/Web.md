You create a sticky web for the duration. Choose up to 4 creatures within range.

Affected creatures make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Stamina](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Stamina.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are [Restrained](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md). They may use their [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to free themselves of the web and cease being [Restrained](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Restrained.md).
