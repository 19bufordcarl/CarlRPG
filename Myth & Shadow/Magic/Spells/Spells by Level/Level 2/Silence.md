You conjure a moveable bubble of soundless air for the duration.

Choose up to 1 target within range. The target and everything [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with it is surrounded by the bubble.

Affected creatures are [Deafened](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deafened.md).

No sound can enter, leave, or be created inside the bubble. **Notably, this means that [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) is impossible in the bubble since it requires speaking.**

An affected creature may use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell by attempting to break themselves free of the bubble.

As an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) on your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you may choose a new target within range for this spell.
