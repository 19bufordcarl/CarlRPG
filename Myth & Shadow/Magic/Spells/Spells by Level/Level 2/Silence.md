| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 60 feet                                                               |

You conjure a sphere of soundless air for the duration.

Create a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered at a point you can see within range.

Affected creatures are [Deafened](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deafened.md).

No sound can enter, leave, or be created inside the aura.

**Notably, this means [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) is impossible inside the aura since it requires speaking.**

---
*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' per spell level.*
