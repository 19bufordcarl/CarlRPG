You conjure a moveable bubble of soundless air for the duration.

Choose up to 1 creature within range. The affected creature is surrounded by the bubble.

The affected creature is [Deafened](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Deafened.md). No sound can enter, leave, or be created inside the bubble.

**Notably, this means [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) is impossible in the bubble since it requires speaking.**

The affected creature may use their [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell by attempting to break themselves free of the bubble.

*Upcast: Conjure 1 additional bubble per spell level.*
