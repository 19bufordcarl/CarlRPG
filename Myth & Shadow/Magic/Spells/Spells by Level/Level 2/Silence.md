| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | None                                                |
| Range    | 60 feet                                             |
| Domains  | [Air](../../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)              |

You conjure a blanket soundless air. Create a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered at a point you can see within range.

No sound can enter, leave, or be created inside the aura. Affected creatures are [Deafened](../../../../Conditions/Deafened.md).

**Notably, this means [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Systems/Spellcasting%20Systems.md) is impossible from inside that sphere since it requires speaking.**

---
*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' per spell level.*
