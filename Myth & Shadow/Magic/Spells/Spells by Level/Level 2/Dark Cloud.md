# Dark Cloud

| Level    | [2nd Level Spell](2nd%20Level%20Spells.md)                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md)     |

For the duration, magical cloud of [Shadowcurse](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) [Darkness](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Darkness.md) fills a [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) you can see within range. [Darkvision](Darkvision.md) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the *Dark Cloud* to fill whatever [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) the object is in. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the *Dark Cloud*.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md) less than or equal to this *Dark Cloud*, that other spell is dispelled.

---
*Upcast: Increase the casting range by 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per spell level.*
