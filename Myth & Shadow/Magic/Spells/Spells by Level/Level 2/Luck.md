| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Rest of the Session                                                   |
| Range    | Touch                                                                 |

You touch one creature, letting it alter the tides of *Fate*. That creature gains 1 [Reroll Token](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md).

A creature can only benefit from this spell once per **session**.

If you do not worship a [Deity](../../../Deities.md), casting this spell tempts the cruel hand of *Fate*. Your next [Critical Success](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md) is treated as a [Critical Failure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).
