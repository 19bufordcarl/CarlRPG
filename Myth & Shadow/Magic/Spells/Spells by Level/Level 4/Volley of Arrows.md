You conjure a massive volley of magical arrows that reign down on a point you can see within range. Draw a line from that point that is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long. That area is pelted with arrows.

Creatures in the affected area take 3d6 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md).

*Upcast: Increase the damage by 1d6 per spell level*
