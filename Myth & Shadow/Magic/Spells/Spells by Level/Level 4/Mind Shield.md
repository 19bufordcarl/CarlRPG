You create an impenetrable magic shield around your mind for the duration.

You are immune to any magical attempt to detect your thoughts, scry on you, or similar magic.

If the day long ritual casting is interrupted, you suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).

*Upcast: Resist higher level counterspells*.
