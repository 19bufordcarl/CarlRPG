You create a magical forcefield that surrounds you for the duration.

The forcefield has 25 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) and 10 [AC](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md). When it is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md), this spell ends.

You cannot take [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) damage so long as the forcefield protects you.

---
*Upcast: Increase the forcefield's HP by 25 per spell level.*
