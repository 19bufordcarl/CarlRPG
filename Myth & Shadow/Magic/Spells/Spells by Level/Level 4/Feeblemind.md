You muddle the mind of one creature you can see within range for the duration.

The affected creature is unable to cast spells, use magic items, and is generally incapable of understanding anything magical. Accordingly, they will not be aware that a magic spell is responsible for their befuddlement.

Affected creatures may use their [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell. They may only make this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) once. A PC may repeat this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) over [Downtime](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
