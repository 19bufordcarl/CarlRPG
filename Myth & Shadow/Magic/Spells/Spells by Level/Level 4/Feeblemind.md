| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled                                     |
| Range    | 30 feet                                             |

You cast a curse at one creature you can see within range. If the creature is higher [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, they can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

The affected creature has their mind muddled for the duration. They are unable to cast spells, but are otherwise not affected too much. They'll just be a bit befuddled about the whole thing.

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
