You muddle the mind of one creature you can see within range for the duration.

The affected creature is unable to cast spells, use magic items, and is generally incapable of understanding anything magical. Accordingly, they will not be aware that a magic spell is responsible for their befuddlement.

If the creature is higher [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
