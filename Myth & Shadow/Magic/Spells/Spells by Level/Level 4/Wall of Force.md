You conjure a wall of pure magical force for the duration.

The wall can connect any two points you can see that are at most 120 feet apart. The wall is 1 foot thick and 30 feet tall.

No physical objects or creatures can move through the wall.

The wall has 25 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) and 10 [AC](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) and is [Immune](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to all [Damage Types](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) except [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md). When it is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md), this spell ends.

---
*Upcast: Increase the HP by 25 per spell level*.
