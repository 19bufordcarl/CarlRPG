You conjure a wall of pure magical force. Create an [Area](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Area.md) you can see that is 30 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 30 feet tall for the duration.

Alternatively you can make a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md), but only the edge of the sphere is affected area.

No physical objects or creatures can move through the wall.
