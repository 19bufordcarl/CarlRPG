You can morph the earth that you touch. Any non-magical material bends to your will, you can morph the material on the order of forming a 5 foot radius 100 foot long cylinder tube through the ground.

*Note: The terrain stays this way permanently*.

---
*Upcast: The length of the tube doubles per spell level.*
