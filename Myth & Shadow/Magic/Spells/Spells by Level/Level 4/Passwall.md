You can morph the earth that you touch.

Any non-magical material bends to your will, you can morph a cylindrical tube through the ground that traverses across up to 3 [Zones](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md).

*Note: The terrain stays this way permanently*.

---
*Upcast: The length of the tube doubles per spell level.*
