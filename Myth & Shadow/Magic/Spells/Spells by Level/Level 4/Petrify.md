For the duration, the affected creature is transformed into stone. The creature you target must be [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 5 or lower. If you maintain [Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md) for the full hour, the petrification becomes permanent.
