You shoot a bolt of petrifying energy at a [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md), [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), or [Monstrosity](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Monstrosity.md) you can see within range. The affected creature is transformed into stone and [Paralyzed](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for the duration.

Affected creatures may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

If you maintain [Concentration](../../Concentration.md) for 1 hour, the petrification becomes permanent.
