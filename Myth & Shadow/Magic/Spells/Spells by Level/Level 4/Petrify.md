You shoot a bolt of petrifying energy at a creature you can see within range. The affected creature is transformed into stone and [Paralyzed](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for the duration.

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 6 or more, it resists this spell.

If you maintain [Concentration](../../Concentration.md) for 1 hour, the petrification becomes permanent.

*Upcast: Increase the affected level by 1 per spell level.*
