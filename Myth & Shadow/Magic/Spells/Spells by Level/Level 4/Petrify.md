You shoot a bolt of petrifying energy at a creature you can see within range. The affected creature is transformed into stone for the duration.

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 6 or more, it resists this spell.

If you maintain [Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md) for the full hour, the petrification becomes permanent.
