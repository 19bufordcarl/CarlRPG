| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled ([Concentration](../../Concentration.md))             |
| Range    | 30 feet                                                               |

You shoot a bolt of petrifying energy at a [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) or [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) you can see within range. The affected creature is transformed into stone and [Paralyzed](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for the duration.

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 8 or more, it makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to resist this spell.

If you maintain [Concentration](../../Concentration.md) for 1 hour, the petrification becomes permanent.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
