You create a cloud of deadly toxic gas centered on a point you can see within range, it has a radius of 15 feet. The cloud remains centered on that point for as long as you retain [Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md).

Affected creatures take 2d6 [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage at the start of their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). If they end their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) fully inside the cloud still, they take 5 times 2d6 [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' per spell level.*
