You can only cast this spell at dawn or dusk and only once per day. It lasts for a full day.

If the affected creature would be reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md), it instead has 1 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) and then the ward breaks, ending this spell's effect.

*Upcast: Increase the HP reset total by 4 per spell level.*
