You can only cast this spell at dawn or dusk and only once per day. It lasts for a full day.

If the affected creature would start [Dying](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Dying.md) because it has 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), it instead has 1 HP, and then the ward breaks, ending this spell's effect.
