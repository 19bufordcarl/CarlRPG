They are compelled to see you as a close friend for the duration of the spell. If the target already harbors friendly feelings toward you, they remain relatively unchanged.

Should you or your allies engage in actions perceived as harmful by the target, the spell ends immediately.

Once the spell ends, the target becomes aware that you charmed them, and will likely become hostile / fearful.
