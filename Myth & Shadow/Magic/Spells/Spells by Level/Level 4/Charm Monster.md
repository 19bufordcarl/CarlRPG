Your magically charm one creature that you can see within range.

They are compelled to see you as a close friend for the duration. If they already harbor friendly feelings toward you, they remain relatively unchanged.

Should you or your allies engage in actions perceived as harmful by the creature, the spell ends immediately.

Once the spell ends, the creature becomes aware that you charmed them, and will likely become hostile / fearful.

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 4 or higher, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell. A creature who is higher [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you automatically succeeds.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
