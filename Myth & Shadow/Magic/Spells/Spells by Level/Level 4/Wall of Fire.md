You conjure a wall of flames for the duration.

Create an [Area](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Area.md) you can see that is 30 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 30 feet tall.

Alternatively you can make a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md), but only the edge of the sphere is affected area.

Once per [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) when a target touches the wall, it takes 4d8 [Fire](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage.
