You create a 5 foot wide, 30 foot long, and 30 foot high wall of fire on a point you can see within range.

Any physical object or creature that touches the wall takes 4d8 [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage. This damage applies at most once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md). It applies when the spell is cast, and at the end of subsequent [Rounds](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md).

---
*Upcast: Increase the damage by 1d8 per spell level.*
