You magically alter the appearance of the terrain within range for the duration.

The illusion can have visual, auditory, and olfactory components.

An affected creature may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) once per day. On a success, they see through the illusion. They may alert their allies who failed this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). They allies are still affected by the illusion, but they know that it is an illusion and proceed with caution.

*Note: Effects like [Truesight](Truesight.md) see through illusions instantly*.

---
*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
