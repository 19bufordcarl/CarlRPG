You make magically alter the apparent appearance of the terrain around you. Create a 250 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md). The affected terrain appears however you specify it to appear for the duration.

For example, you could make a stinky swamp appear like a lush valley.

A creature that is higher [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check at the start of every hour it spends in the terrain. On a success, it sees through the illusion. It may alert it's allies of lower level, who may then make their own [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check. On a failure, they are still affected by the illusion but will know that it is an illusion and be cautious. The lower level creatures may not repeat this check.

*(Reminder: Effects like [Truesight](Truesight.md) see through the illusion instantly)*

---
*Upcast: Increase the aura by 250 feet per spell level.*
