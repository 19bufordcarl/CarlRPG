You attempt to commune with a deceased soul or otherworldly entity. You can ask this entity 3 yes or no questions. The GM answers for the entity. If the PCs relationship with the entity is good, then the GM's answer should be truthful.

If communing with a deceased soul, you must have something to bind that spirit to the mortal realm again. This could be; their body, an heirloom, their direct descendant, or similar.

Otherwise, the GM can answer however they believe the entity would. They may allow for the caster to make a [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine if the PC believes the entity was being truthful.
