You attempt to commune with an otherworldly spirit or [Deity](../../../Deities/Deities.md). You can ask this being 3 yes or no questions. The GM answers for the being. If the PCs relationship with the being is good, then the GM's answer should be truthful (for example, a priest communes with their god). 

Otherwise, the GM can answer however they believe the being would. They may allow for the caster to make a [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine if the PC believes the being was being truthful.
