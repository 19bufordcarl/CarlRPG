You attempt to commune with a deceased soul, otherworldly spirit, or [Deity](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Deities/Deities.md). You can ask this being 3 yes or no questions. The GM answers for the being. If the PCs relationship with the being is good, then the GM's answer should be truthful (for example, a priest communes with their god).

If communing with a deceased soul, you must have something to bind that spirit to the mortal realm again. This could be; their body, an heirloom, their direct descendant, or similar.

Otherwise, the GM can answer however they believe the being would. They may allow for the caster to make a [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to determine if the PC believes the being was being truthful.
