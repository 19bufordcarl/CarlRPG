You conjure an arcane eye that lasts for the duration.

The eye must remain within range at all times. The eye has the following properties:

- It is [Invisible](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Invisible.md) and can fly.
- It can see in the dark, even the [Shadowcurse](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Hazards/Shadowcurse.md).
- It can fit through narrow spaces, such as a keyhole.

---
*Upcast: Increase the range by 1 [Zone](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Zone.md) per spell level.*
