You can create an arcane eye within range. It is [Invisible](../../../../Conditions/Invisible.md), and can fly. It must remain within 30 feet of you at all times. This eye can see in the dark, even the [Shadowcurse](../../../../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). It can fit through narrow spaces, such as a keyhole.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' per spell level.*
