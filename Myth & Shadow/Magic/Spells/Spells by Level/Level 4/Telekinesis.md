When you cast this spell and as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) for the duration, you may move an object in weight up to a humanoid in plate mail. You can move the object 30 feet in any direction.

If you attempt to throw the object into something, it takes 3d6 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md).

If the target is a creature, it may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) *or* [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell â€” the target chooses which.

*Upcast: At 5th level, you can move an object in weight up to a horse and laden wagon.*
