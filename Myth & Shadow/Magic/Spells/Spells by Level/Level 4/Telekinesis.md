You gain the ability to move targets within range using magic for the duration.

As part of casting the spell or as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) on a following [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you may move a target no larger than a bear.

An affected creature may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) **or** [Physical Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Physical%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell â€” the affected creature chooses which.
