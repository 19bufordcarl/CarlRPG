# Mark and Recall

| Level    | [4th Level Spells](4th%20Level%20Spells.md)         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | Until dispelled                                     |
| Range    | Self                                                |

You can spend one day to "mark" a location, enchanting it as your "homebase" for the duration.

At a later point, you can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) "recall" to teleport yourself to that place. Doing so breaks the mark, the ritual must be redone before you can use this again.

*A homebase should be specified to be at most a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md)*

---
*Upcast: You can teleport willing creatures within 30 feet at 5th level.*
