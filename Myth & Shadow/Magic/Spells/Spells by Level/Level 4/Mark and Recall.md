You can spend one day to *Mark* a location, enchanting it as your *Anchor* for the duration.

At a later point, you can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) *Recall* to teleport yourself to your *Anchor*. Doing so breaks the *Mark* and this spell ends.

*An Anchor should be specified to be at most a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md)*.

---
*Upcast: You can teleport any willing creatures within 30 feet at 5th level.*
