You can spend one day to "mark" a location (5 foot cube) and enchant it as your "homebase". At any later point, you can then "recall" to teleport yourself to that place. Doing so breaks the mark, the ritual must be redone before you can use this again.

*Upcast: You can teleport willing creatures within 30 feet at 5th level.*
