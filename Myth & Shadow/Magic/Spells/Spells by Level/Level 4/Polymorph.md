You touch a creature, transforming it into another creature of your choosing for the duration.

The chosen creature must be considered natural to the setting of the world as determined by the GM. By default, any extant or extinct real life animal is considered natural.

The touched creature assumes all statistics of the chosen creature, but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)). If the touched creature is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and gain the [Exhausted](../../../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

You can target any willing creature; or an unwilling creature whose [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than or equal to [Half](../../../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). Otherwise, the target resists the spell.
