You touch a creature, transforming it into an [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) of your choosing for the duration.

The touched creature assumes all statistics of the chosen [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md)). If the touched creature is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and gain the [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

You can target any willing creature, or an unwilling [Humanoid](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md). If the target is unwilling, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.
