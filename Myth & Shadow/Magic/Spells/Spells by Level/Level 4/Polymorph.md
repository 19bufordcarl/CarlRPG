You touch a creature, transforming it into an [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) of your choosing for the duration.

The affected creature assumes all statistics of the chosen [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md)). If they are reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and become [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) and [Wounded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

The affected creature may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 and the max animal level by 1 per spell level.*

***Scribe's Note:***
*The highest [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) of an [Animal](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/Animal.md) ever recorded in the Imperial Library is 12.*
