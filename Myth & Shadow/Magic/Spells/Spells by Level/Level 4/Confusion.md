You evoke an aura of confusion. Create a 30 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on a point you can see within range for the duration.

Affected creatures are *confused*. They attack the nearest target to them. If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 3 or higher, they may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 18 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.
