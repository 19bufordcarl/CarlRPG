You are protected by rock hard magical skin for the duration.

You are [Resistant](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Resistant.md) to all [Damage Types](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) and [Damage Tiers](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/{Damage%20Tiers}.md) except [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md).

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
