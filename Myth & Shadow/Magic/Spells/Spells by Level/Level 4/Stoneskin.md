You are protected by rock hard magical skin for the duration.

You are [Resistant](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Resistant.md) to all [Damage Types](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/{Damage%20Types}.md) except [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) and [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md).

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
