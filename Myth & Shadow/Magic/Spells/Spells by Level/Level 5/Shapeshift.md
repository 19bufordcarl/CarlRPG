You touch a target, transforming it into another creature of your choosing for the duration.

The chosen creature must be [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 10 or lower. The touched target's gear magically morphs to their new form.

The touched target assumes all statistics of the chosen creature, but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md)). If the touched target is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and gain the [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

If the target is unwilling, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to resist this spell.
