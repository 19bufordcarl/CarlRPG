| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md)                       |

| Range    | Touch                                                                     |

You touch a creature, transforming it into any [Creature Type](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/{Creature%20Types}.md) of your choosing for the duration.

The chosen [Creature Type](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/{Creature%20Types}.md) must be [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md) 15 or lower. The affected creature's [Equipment](../../../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Equipment.md) magically morphs to their new form.

The affected creature assumes all statistics of the chosen [Creature Type](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creature%20Types/{Creature%20Types}.md), but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Charisma.md)). If they are reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and become [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md) and [Wounded](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Wounded.md).

The affected creature may make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Health](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to [Resist](../../Resist.md) this spell.
