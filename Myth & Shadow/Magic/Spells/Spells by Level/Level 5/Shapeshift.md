You touch a creature, transforming it into another creature of your choosing for the duration.

The chosen creature must be [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 10 or lower. The touched creature's gear magically morphs to their new form.

The touched creature assumes all statistics of the chosen creature, but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)). If the touched creature is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and gain the [Exhausted](../../../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

You can target any willing creature; or an unwilling creature whose [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than or equal to [Half](../../../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). Otherwise, the target resists the spell.
