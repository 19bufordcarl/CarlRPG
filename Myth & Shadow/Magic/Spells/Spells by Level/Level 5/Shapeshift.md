# Shapeshift

| Level    | [5th Level Spells](5th%20Level%20Spells.md)                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)              |
| Duration | 1 hour ([Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md)) |
| Range    | Touch                                                            |
| Domains  | [Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md)                       |

For the duration, the affected creature is transformed into another creature of your choosing of [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 10 or lower. Their gear magically morphs into this new form.

The transformed creature assumes all statistics of the target creature, but they retain their own mental statistics ([Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md), and [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)). If the creature is reduced to 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) while transformed, they revert to their true form and gain the [Exhausted](../../../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

You can target any willing creature; or an unwilling creature whose [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than or equal to [Half](../../../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md). Otherwise, the target resists the spell.
