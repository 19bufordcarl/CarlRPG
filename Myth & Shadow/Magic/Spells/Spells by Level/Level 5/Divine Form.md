This spell can only be learned from an archpriest of a [Deity](../../../Deities.md). If you do not worship the [Deity](../../../Deities.md), casting this spell will anger them greatly.

You take on a divine form of the Deity's choosing for the duration.

You can fly a distance equal to your normal [Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md), all your [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) deal [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage, and you gain a +4 bonus to all [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) **and** damage rolls.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
