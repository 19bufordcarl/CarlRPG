*This spell can only be learned from a [Deity](../../../Deities.md) directly, it is lost to time.*

You take on a divine form, evoking the visage of a [Deity](../../../Deities.md) for the duration.

You can fly a distance equal to your normal [Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md), all your [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) deal [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) damage, and you gain a +4 bonus to all [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) **and** damage rolls.

If you fall [Unconscious](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), the spell ends.
