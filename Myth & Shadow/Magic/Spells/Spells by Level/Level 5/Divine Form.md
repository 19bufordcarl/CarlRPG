For the duration, you take on a divine form of your choosing.

You can fly a distance equal to your normal [Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md), all your [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) deal [Mythril Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md). You have a +4 to all [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) **and** damage rolls.

If you do not worship a [Deity](../../../Deities/Deities.md) whom you get your divine form from, this spell will anger the deities of the setting, who will see you as a mortal challenging them. What they do next is up to the GM.
