You take on a divine form of your Deity's choosing for the duration.

You can fly a distance equal to your normal [Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md), all your [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) deal [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md). You have a +4 to all [Attack](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) **and** damage rolls.

If you do not worship a [Deity](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Deities/Deities.md), this spell will anger the deities of the setting, who will see you as a mortal challenging them. What they do next is up to the GM.
