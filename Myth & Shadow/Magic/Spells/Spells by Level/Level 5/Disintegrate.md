You attempt to disincorporate 1 target you can see within range.

The affected target takes 20 + 2d12 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md). If this reduces them to 0 [Hit Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md), the target is turned into a pile of ash, along with any of its [Equipment](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Equipment.md).

Non-magical objects up to the size of an average dragon are destroyed.
