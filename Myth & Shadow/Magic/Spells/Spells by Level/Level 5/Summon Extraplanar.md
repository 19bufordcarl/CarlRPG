You can summon a creature of magical origin that you have studied extensively for the duration.

The [The Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) has a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) of 10 + the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) for this spell.

If you lose [Concentration](../../Concentration.md), the creature remains on this plane, but becomes hostile towards its mind controller â€” you. It will, accordingly, also be hostile to your allies.

When you lose [Concentration](../../Concentration.md), you can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Mental Defense](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to banish the creature to its plane of origin, where XX is equal to 10 + the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
