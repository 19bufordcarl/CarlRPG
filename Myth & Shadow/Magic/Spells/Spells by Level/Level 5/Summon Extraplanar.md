You can bind a soul from [Oblivion](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md) to a creature that you have studied extensively for the duration.

A PC can only have one soul bound to them at a time.

If you lose [Concentration](../../Concentration.md), the creature remains on this plane, but becomes hostile towards its mind controller â€” you. It will, accordingly, also be hostile to your allies.

When you lose [Concentration](../../Concentration.md), you can use an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Magicka](../../../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to banish the creature to its plane of origin, where XX is equal to 10 + the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Level.md).

*Upcast: Decrease the DC by 5 per spell level.*
