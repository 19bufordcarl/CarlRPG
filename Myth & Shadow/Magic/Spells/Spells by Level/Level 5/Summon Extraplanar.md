You can summon a creature of magical origin whom you have studied the origins of who is lower [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you are.

If you lose [Concentration](../../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md), the creature becomes hostile towards you and your allies (but you especially) for dominating its mind. If you cast this spell directly, you can then make a [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to banish the creature. The [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) is equal to 10 + the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).
