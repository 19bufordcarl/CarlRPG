You create an impenetrable magic shield for you mind. You are immune to any magical attempt to detect your thoughts, scry on you, or similar for the duration.

If the day long ritual casting is interrupted, you suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md).
