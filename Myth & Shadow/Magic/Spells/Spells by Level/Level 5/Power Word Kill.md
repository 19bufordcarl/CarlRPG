You choose 1 target creature you can see within range and speak the unspeakable curse.

If they are lower [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, they instantly die.

If they are greater [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, or you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
