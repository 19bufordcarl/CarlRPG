You create a portal to a location of your choosing on a plane of your choosing. You must teleport to a teleportation circle of which you are familiar with the sigil sequence. If know no teleportation sigil sequences on that plane, it teleports to a random location on that plane.

The portal remains open for 1 minute, and up to 12 creatures can go through it at once. If you have been to the location you are teleporting to before, the portal is transparent, otherwise, it is opaque.

If possible, you should inform them of places you wish to portal to the session prior to doing so, this gives the GM time to prep any details of that plane they need to run it.
