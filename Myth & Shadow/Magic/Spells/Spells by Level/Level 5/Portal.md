You create a portal to a plane of your choosing for the duration.

The portal can connect to a teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. If you do not connect to a teleportation circle, the portal connects to a random location on the chosen plane.

The portal remains open for 1 minute, and up to 12 creatures can go through it at once. If you have been to the location you are teleporting to before, the portal is transparent. Otherwise, the portal is opaque.

If possible, you should inform the GM of places you wish to portal to the session prior to doing so. This gives the GM time to prep any details for the desired place.
