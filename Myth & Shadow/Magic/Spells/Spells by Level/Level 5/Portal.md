You create a portal to a plane of your choosing for the duration.

You must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Concentration](../../Concentration.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) at the start of your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to maintain this spell.

The portal can connect to a teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. If you do not connect to a teleportation circle, the portal connects to a random location on the chosen plane.

While the portal is open, up to 6 creatures can go through it per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md). If you have been to the location you are teleporting to before, the portal is transparent. Otherwise, the portal is opaque.

---
*Upcast: Decrease the DC by 5 per spell level.*

*If possible, you should inform the GM of places you wish to portal to the session prior to doing so. The GM needs time to prep any details for the desired place.*
