You utter the forbidden incantations of undeath to create undead for the duration.

You bind a soul from [Oblivion](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Oblivion.md) to a **Greater Undead**. It acts on your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) and is controlled by you.

A PC can only have one soul bound to them at a time.

## Greater Undead

[Immune](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to [Tier 1](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) [Blunt](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Blunt.md), [Edged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Edged.md), and [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.
