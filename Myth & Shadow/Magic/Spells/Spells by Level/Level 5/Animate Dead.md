You utter the forbidden incantations of undeath to create undead for the duration.

Choose classic summon or horde summon.

## Classic Summon

You create a **Greater Undead**. It acts on your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) and is controlled by you.

### Greater Undead

Does not make [Morale](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Morale.md) [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md). [Immune](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to [Mundane Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).

|  AC |  HP | d20 Bonus | # Attacks | Damage | Melee Bash |
| --: | --: | --------: | --------: | -----: | ---------: |
|  16 |  40 |         7 |         3 |    2d8 |          4 |

It disintegrates into smoke and dust after 1 day.

## Horde Summon

You summon a [Large](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Sizes) horde of skeletons.

When another creature becomes [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the horde, you may have the horde deal 2d6 [Mundane Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) to them. The horde can only deal damage once per [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

During your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can move the horde up to 30 feet. The horde must be able to walk to where you direct them to go. The horde has no other [Actions](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

The horde can be attacked. The horde has 40 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md). At 20 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) or less remaining, the damage dealt by the horde is reduced to 1d6. The horde is destroyed at 0 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md).
