You utter the forbidden incantations of unholy undeath to create undead for the duration.

Choose classic summon or horde summon.

## Classic Summon

You create a **Greater Undead**. It acts on your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) and is controlled by you.

### Greater Undead

Does not make [Morale](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Social%20Procedures/Morale.md) checks. [Immune](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Immune.md) to [Mundane Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).

|  AC |  HP | d20 Bonus | # Attacks | Damage | Melee Bash |
| --: | --: | --------: | --------: | -----: | ---------: |
|  16 |  40 |         7 |         3 |    2d8 |          4 |

It disintegrates into smoke and dust after 1 day.

## Horde Summon

You summon a horde of skeletons, they stick together in a 10 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md). If another creature is inside the aura, you may have the skeletons deal 2d6 [Mundane Damage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md) to them. A creature only takes this damage once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

During your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can move this aura 30 feet. The skeletons must be able to walk to where you direct them to go.

The skeletons can be attacked. Treat this aura as if it has 40 HP. At 20 HP or less remaining, the damage dealt is reduced to 1d6.
