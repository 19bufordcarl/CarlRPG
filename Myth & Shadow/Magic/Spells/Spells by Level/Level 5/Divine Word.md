This spell can only be learned from an archpriest of a [Deity](../../../Deities.md). If you do not worship the [Deity](../../../Deities.md), casting this spell will anger them greatly.

You utter the power of the divine.

Choose a [Domain](../../Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) that the Deity despises. Create a 30 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you. Affected creatures that are associated with chosen domain suffer the appropriate effect for the duration.
