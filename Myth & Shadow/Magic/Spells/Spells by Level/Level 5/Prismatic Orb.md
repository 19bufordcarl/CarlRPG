You shoot an orb of pure elemental energy at a target creature you can see within range.

Choose one of the elemental damage types:

- [Cold](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Cold.md)
- [Fire](../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)
- [Lightning](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Lightning.md)

The target takes 3d12 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) damage of the chosen type and then becomes [Vulnerable](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Vulnerable.md) to it.

---
*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d12 damage per spell level.*
