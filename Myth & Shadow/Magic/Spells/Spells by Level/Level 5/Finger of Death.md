You choose 1 target creature you can see within range and give them the touch of death.

- If they are lower [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, they instantly die.
- If they are the same [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) as you, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Constitution.md) check. On a failure, they die and you take [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage equal to the damage dealt.
- If they are greater [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
