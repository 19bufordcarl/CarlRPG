You choose 1 target creature you can see within range and give them the touch of death.

If they are lower [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, they instantly die.

If they are greater than or equal to your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
