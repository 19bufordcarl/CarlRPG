You touch one creature with the finger of death.

The affected creature takes 10 x 1d12 [Tier 3](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%203.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.

If this damage reduces a PC's [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Point%20Pools/Health%20Points.md) to 0, they gain 5 [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Progression/Scars.md).
