You choose 1 target creature you can see within range and give them the touch of death.

- If they are lower [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) than you, they instantly die.
- If they are the same [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) as you, you must choose one:
	- Kill them, then you take [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage equal to the damage dealt.
	- Suffer a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md).
- If they are greater than your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), a [Critical Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
