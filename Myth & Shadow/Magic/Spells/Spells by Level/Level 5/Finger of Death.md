You touch one creature with the finger of death.

The affected creature takes 1d100 [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.

If this damage reduces a PC's [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) to 0, they gain 5 [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).
