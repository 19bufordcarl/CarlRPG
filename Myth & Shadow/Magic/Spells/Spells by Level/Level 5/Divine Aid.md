This spell can only be learned from an archpriest of a [Deity](../../../Deities.md). If you do not worship the [Deity](../../../Deities.md), casting this spell will anger them greatly.

You summon divine entities to your aid for the duration.

Choose classic summon or swarm summon.

## Classic Summon

You summon a [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 16 Angel / Demon for the duration. You control it.

## Swarm Summon

You summon a swarm of intangible spirits in a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md). While you are inside the aura, you have [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) you may. If another creature is inside the aura, you may have the spirits deal 3d6 [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) / [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage to them. A creature only takes this damage once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).

During your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can move this aura 30 feet in any direction. The spirits are intangible, meaning they can fly and pass through objects.
