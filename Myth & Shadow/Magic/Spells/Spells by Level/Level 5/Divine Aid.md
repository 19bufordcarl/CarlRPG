Divine entities come to your aid for the duration, if you have a good relationship with a [Deity](../../../Deities/Deities.md).

Your Deity will require a sacrifice after you cast this spell before you can cast it again.

Choose classic or swarm.

## Classic Summon

You summon a [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 16 Angel / Demon for the duration.

## Swarm Summon

You summon a swarm of intangible spirits in a 5 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md). While you are inside the aura, you have [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) you may. If another creature is inside the aura, you may have the spirits deal 3d6 [Holy](../../../../Damage%20Types/Holy.md) / [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage to them. A creature can only take this damage once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md).

During your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can move this aura 30 feet in any direction. The spirits are intangible, meaning they can fly and pass through objects.
