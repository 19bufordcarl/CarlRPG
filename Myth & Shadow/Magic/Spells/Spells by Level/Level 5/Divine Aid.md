This spell can only be learned from a [Deity](../../../Deities.md) directly, it is lost to time.

You summon divine entities to your aid for the duration.

Choose classic summon or swarm summon.

## Classic Summon

You summon a [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 16 [Angel](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Angel.md) or [Demon](../../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Demon.md) for the duration. You control it.

## Horde Summon

You summon a [Large](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Geometry.md#Sizes) horde of intangible spirits.

While you are [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the horde, you have [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

When another creature becomes [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the horde, you may have the horde deal 3d6 [Pure](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Pure.md) or [Necrotic](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) to them. This effect can only trigger once per [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

During your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md), you can move the horde up to 30 feet in any direction. The horde is intangible â€” it can fly and pass through objects. The horde cannot take any other [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).
