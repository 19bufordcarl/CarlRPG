This spell can only be learned from a [Deity](../../../Deities.md) directly, it is lost to time.

You call on the [Deity](../../../Deities.md) for help. Choose any [4th Level Spells](../Level%204/4th%20Level%20Spells.md) or lower and copy its effect. If you choose a lower [Spell Level](../../Spell%20Level.md), you may upcast it to 4th level.
