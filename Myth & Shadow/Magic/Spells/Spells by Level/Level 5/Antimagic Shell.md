You conjure an invisible field of pure reality. Create a 15 foot [Aura](../../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) at a point you can see within range for the duration.

Within the aura, no spells can be cast. Magic items (and similar) have no effect inside the field, and no magic can enter the field. Attempts to [Counterspell](../Level%203/Counterspell.md) or otherwise dispel the field have no effect, including the effects of another [Antimagic Shell](Antimagic%20Shell.md).
