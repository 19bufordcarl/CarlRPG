You conjure an invisible field of pure reality for the duration.

Choose an object within range.

For everything [Engaged](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with the object and the object itself, the following rules apply:

- They cannot cast [Spells](../../../Spells.md).
- None of their magic, including magic items, has any magical effects.
- No [Spells](../../../Spells.md) can affect them.

Attempts to [Counterspell](../Level%203/Counterspell.md) or otherwise dispel the field have no effect, including the effects of another [Antimagic Shell](Antimagic%20Shell.md).
