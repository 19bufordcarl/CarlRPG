This spell can only be learned from an archpriest of a [Deity](../../../Deities.md). If you do not worship the [Deity](../../../Deities.md), casting this spell will anger them greatly.

You touch one creature who is less than or equal to your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).

If the creature's life and actions and in line with the Deity's values, they are healed entirely.
*Heals all [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md), negative [Conditions](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md), etc.*

If they are against the Deity's values, they are reduced to 1 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) and are [Exhausted](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Exhausted.md).

If it is neutral, nothing happens.

You can only cast this spell once per creature â€” once in a creature's entire existence.
