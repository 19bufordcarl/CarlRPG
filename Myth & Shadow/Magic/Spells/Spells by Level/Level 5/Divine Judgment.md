| Level    | [5th Level Spells](5th%20Level%20Spells.md)                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)                                  |
| Duration | 1 minute                                                                             |
| Range    | Touch                                                                                |
| Domains  | [Life](../../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md), [Earth](../../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md) |

You attempt to banish one creature you touch who is less than or equal to your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) for the duration. You can only attempt to cast this spell if you have a good relationship with a [Deity](../../../Deities/Deities.md).

If your Deity approves of the creature's life and actions, it will heal it entirely ([HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), [FP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md), [Conditions](../../../../Conditions/!Conditions.md), etc.) Otherwise, it will reduce it to 1 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and grant it the [Exhausted](../../../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

You can only cast this spell once per creature (in that creature's entire existence).
