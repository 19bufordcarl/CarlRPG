You look into a magic item that you have spent at least one day enchanting for this purpose (a crystal ball, reflecting pool, etc.)

You can see and hear a creature or location of your choosing that is on the same plane as you for the duration. After every question you ask the GM about the scried location, the creature on which you are scrying can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to realize they are being magically scried on.

The GM may allow PCs capable of casting [3rd Level Spells](../Level%203/3rd%20Level%20Spells.md) to study this spell to enchant an area against scrying magic through ritual practice. This still costs the normal [Mythril](../../../Spellcasting/Mythril.md) cost of the spell.
