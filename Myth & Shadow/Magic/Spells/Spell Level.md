# Spell Level

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. A PC can only [Memorize](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) spells that are within range of their [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Max Spell Level

A PC's max spell level is determined by their [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).

| Mental Defense | Max Spell Level                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 or less      | Cannot Cast Spells                                                        |
| 2-3            | [1st Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 4-5            | [2nd Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 6-7            | [3rd Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%203/3rd%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 8-9            | [4th Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/4th%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 10-11          | [5th Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 12+            | [Mythic Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Mythic/{Mythic%20Spells}.md)          |

*Reminder: Spell levels are different from a character's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).*

## Mathematics

In mathematical terms, a PCs max spell level is equal to [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).
