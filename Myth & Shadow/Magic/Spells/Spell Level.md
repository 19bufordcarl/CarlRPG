## Max Spell Level

We define a PC's Max Spell Level (known as *Magic Power*) by the lesser of:

1. Their [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and
2. Their ([Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) +1)

| *Magic Power* | Max Spell Level                                                           | Mythril Consumed |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| 1 or less     | Cannot Cast Spells                                                        |              N/A |
| 2-3           | [1st Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md) |               10 |
| 4-5           | [2nd Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md) |               25 |

| 8-9           | [4th Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/4th%20Level%20Spells.md) |              250 |
| 10-11         | [5th Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md) |            1,000 |
| 12+           | [Mythic Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Mythic/!Mythic%20Spells.md)           |          10,000+ |

Said differently, a PCs maximum spell level is equal to the lesser of:

- [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md)
- [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their ([Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + 1)

You can only [Upcast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) to a level less than or equal to your *Max Spell Level*.

*Reminder: Spell levels are different from a character's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).*
