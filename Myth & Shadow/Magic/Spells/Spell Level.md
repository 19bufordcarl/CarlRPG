# Spell Level

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. Typically, a [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) of certain level is accessible to a Caster according to the following rules.

## Max Spell Level

| Minimum of [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and ([Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + 1) | Max Spell Level                                                               | Mythril Costs |

A PCs maximum spell level is equal to the minimum of these two values:
1. Their [Intelligence](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Halved](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving)
2. Their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + 1, [Halved](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving)

You can only upcast spells to a level less than or equal to your max spell level.

*Author's Note:*
*Spell levels are a distinct concept from a character's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), which partially informs spell level.*
