# Spell Level

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. A PC can only [Memorize](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) spells that are within range of their [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Max Spell Level

We define a PC's *Discipline Level* for a [Spellcasting Discipline](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/{Spellcasting%20Disciplines}.md) by the **lesser** of:

1. That [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Ability.md)
2. Their [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) plus 1

We then use this to determine their max spell level for spells from that discipline.

| *Discipline Level* | Max Spell Level                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 or less          | Cannot Cast Spells                                                        |
| 2-3                | [1st Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 4-5                | [2nd Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 6-7                | [3rd Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%203/3rd%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 8-9                | [4th Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%204/4th%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 10-11              | [5th Level Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md) |
| 12+                | [Mythic Spells](Spells%20by%20Level/Mythic/{Mythic%20Spells}.md)           |

*Reminder: Spell levels are different from a character's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md).*

## Mathematics

In mathematical terms, a PCs maximum spell level is equal to the lesser of:

- [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Ability.md)
- [Half](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Half.md) their ([Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + 1)
