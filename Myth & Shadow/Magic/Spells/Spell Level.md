# Spell Level

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. Typically, a [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) of certain level is accessible to a Caster according to the following rules.

## Max Spell Level

| Minimum of [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) and ([Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + 1) | Max Spell Level                                                           | Mythril Costs |

Mathematically, a PCs maximum spell level is equal to the minimum of:

1. [Half](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) their [Spellcasting Ability](../The%20Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md)
2. [Half](../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) their ([Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) + 1)

You can only [Upcast](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) to a level less than or equal to your max spell level.

*Author's Note:*
*Spell levels are a distinct concept from a character's [Level](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), which partially informs spell level.*
