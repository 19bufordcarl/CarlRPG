# Concentration

Spells that require concentration over a duration can end prior to their stated duration if something were to break your concentration. You can only concentrate on one spell at a time. The list of ways that concentration can break are:

- Casting another spell that requires concentration.
- If an enemy inflicts a [Condition](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/!Conditions.md) on you, make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to retain concentration.
- When you take [FP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) damage, make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to retain concentration.
- When you take [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) damage, make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Wisdom](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check to retain concentration.
- If you are [Unconscious](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md) or [Incapacitated](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md), you cannot maintain concentration.
