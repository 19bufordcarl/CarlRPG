# Concentration

Spells that require concentration over a duration can end prior to their stated duration if something were to break the caster's concentration.

A *Concentration Check* is a [Health](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md).

The list of ways that concentration can break are:

- Casting another spell that requires concentration. You can only concentrate on one spell.
- When you take [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) damage, make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) XX [Health](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Health.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to retain concentration.
	- XX is equal to the DC of [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
- If you are [Incapacitated](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md), you cannot maintain concentration.
	- *Note: [Paralyzed](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md) causes [Incapacitated](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md), and [Unconscious](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md) causes [Paralyzed](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md).*

A PC can stop concentrating on a spell whenever they want.
