# Concentration

Spells that require concentration over a duration can end prior to their stated duration if something were to break that concentration.

The list of ways that concentration can break are:

- Casting another spell that requires concentration. You can only concentrate on one spell.
- When you take [HP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Hit%20Points.md) damage, make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to retain concentration.
- Certain [Conditions](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/{Conditions}.md) require you to make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to retain concentration.
- If you are [Unconscious](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Unconscious.md), you cannot maintain concentration.

A PC can stop concentrating on a spell at any time as a [Free Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Free%20Action).
