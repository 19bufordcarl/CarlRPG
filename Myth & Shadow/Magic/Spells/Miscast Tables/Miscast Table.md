# Miscast Table

When you roll a [Critical Miscast](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md), you must roll on this table. Whatever the [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) was for [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), subtract 12 from that number and add that the d12 roll.

*This means [1st Level Spells](../Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md) add +0 and [5th Level Spells](../Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md) add +8.*

| d12+ | Miscast Name             | Miscast Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
