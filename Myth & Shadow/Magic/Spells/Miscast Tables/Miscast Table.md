# Miscast Table

When you roll a [Critical Miscast](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miscast.md), you must roll on this table. For each spell level after 1st that the spell you failed was, add 2 to the d12 roll, up to a maximum of +8 for [5th Level Spells](../Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md).

| d12+ | Miscast Name             | Miscast Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

[Attacks](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) against you are made with [Advantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|    6 | **Refraction**           | The spell target(s) becomes yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|    7 | **Discordant**           | You forget the failed spell. You remember it after a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|    8 | **Horror**               | You scream uncontrollably for 3 [Rounds](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|   10 | **Instability**          | You have [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for the next 10 [Rounds](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md) for [2nd Level Spells](../Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).                                                                                                             |
|   11 | **Explosion**            | Create a 15 foot [Aura](../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered on you. Affected creatures take d6 [Fire](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage%20Types/Fire.md) damage per spell level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|   13 | **Big Hole**             | Create a 15 foot [Aura](../Areas%20of%20Effect/Aura.md) centered 15 feet below you. The ground in the affected area vanishes. The ground above this sphere collapses, causing all creatures standing on it to fall 30 feet down. Affected creatures, except you, can make a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Dexterity](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) check to run to the edge and avoid falling in. |
|   14 | **Petrification**        | You are petrified to stone, and suffer from [Paralysis](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Paralyzed.md) for the next hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   15 | **Madness**              | You glimpse the unfathomable, make a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Wisdom.md) check or descend in mad ravings for d4 [Delve Rounds](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round). While raving, you are [Incapacitated](../../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Incapacitated.md).                                                                  |
|   16 | **Vanishing**            | One random magic item you have vanishes forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|   17 | **Magnet**               | All hostile creatures are drawn to you like a flame. They attempt to [Attack](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) you if at all possible for the next hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   18 | **Curse of the Mundane** | You have [Disadvantage](../../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Disadvantage.md) on [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) until you complete a [Long Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   19 | **Planar Tear**          | A magic portal to another plane is opened. A dreadful monster ([Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 15 or higher) will come through if you do not close it. You can make a [DC](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Intelligence](../../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Intelligence.md) check as an [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to close the tear.            |
|   20 | **Doom**                 | An unknowable cosmic being has seen you and marked you for death. You know your doom is inevitable, but not the hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
