# Miscast Table

When you roll a [Critical Miscast](../../Spellcasting/Critical%20Miscast.md), you must roll on this table. Add 2 to this roll for each [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md) above 1st that this spell was.

*This means [1st Level Spells](../Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md) add +0 and [5th Level Spells](../Spells%20by%20Level/Level%205/5th%20Level%20Spells.md) add +8.*
