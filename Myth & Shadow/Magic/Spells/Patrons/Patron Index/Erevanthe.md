## Erevantheâ€™s Banes
- If you fail a [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) check from a [Spell](../../../Spells.md) Erevanthe has taught you, you take [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage equal to twice the [Spell's Level](../../../Spell%20Levels.md). 

- If you [Critically Miscast](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) a [Spell](../../../Spells.md) Erevanthe has taught you, you must make a **gold** sacrifice bound with a drop of your blood according to the [Penance](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast#Penance%20Sacrifice%20Value) table value.
	- **You cannot cast that spell again until you do so.**

- You have [Disadvantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) casting any [Spells](../../../Spells.md) not learned through Erevanthe.

- Leaving Erevanthe's faith grants you the cursed tongue of a heretic.
	- Your [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

## Erevanthe's Ethos
Queen of shadows, secrets, and the power of words not said. The power between true and false, light and shadow, good and evil. The ashen [Infernals](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Infernals.md) claim her as the founder of their culture and the one responsible for their 'blessed' forms. 

Erevanthe expects strict devotion from her followers, obedience is valued above all, shadows and secrets hold the keys to power, she knows all, and you need to know not.
