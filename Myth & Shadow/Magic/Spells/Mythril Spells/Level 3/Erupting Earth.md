You sunder the ground itself, cause stones to erupt from the ground in a 30 foot radius of you.

All creatures other than you in the area take 3d12 [Mundane Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mundane%20Damage.md).

This moving through the affected area becomes [Difficult Movement](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement) permanently.
- Or until somebody spends a full day of labor clearing the rubble.
