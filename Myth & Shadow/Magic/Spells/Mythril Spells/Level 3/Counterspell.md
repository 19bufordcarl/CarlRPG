You choose one caster you can see within range when they cast a spell to negate that spell. You may know the spell being cast, and you may cast this after the referee makes the related die rolls.

If the [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is [2nd Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md) or lower, it is immediately countered.

If the [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is [3rd Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md) or higher, compare the result of your [Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to the target's [Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll). If yours is higher, the spell is countered. If it is a tie or worse, the spell resolves normally.
