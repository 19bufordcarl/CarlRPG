# Counterspell

| Level    | [3rd Level Spell](3rd%20Level%20Spells.md)            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Reaction](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) |
| Duration | None                                                    |
| Range    | 60 feet                                                 |
| Domains  | [Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md)              |

You choose one caster you can see within range when they make [A Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to counter their spell.

If the [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is [2nd Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md) or lower, it is immediately countered.

If the [Spell](../../../Spells.md) is [3rd Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md) or higher, compare the result of your [Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) to the target's [Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll). If yours is higher, the spell is counter. If it is a tie or worse, the spell resolves normally.
