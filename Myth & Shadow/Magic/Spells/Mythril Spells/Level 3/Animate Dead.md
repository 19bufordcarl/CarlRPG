You touch one humanoid's dead body, speaking the incantation imbuing unholy undeath upon it.

The creature uses the statistics of a lesser zombie, and acts on your [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md), controlled by you. 

The zombie disintegrates into dust after 1 day.


*Upcast: Increase the duration by 1 day per spell level*
