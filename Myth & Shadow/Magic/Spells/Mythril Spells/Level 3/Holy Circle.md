# Holy Circle

| Level    | [3rd Level Spell](3rd%20Level%20Spells.md)          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | 1 hour ([Concentration](../../../Concentration.md)) |
| Range    | Self, AOE                                           |
| Domains  | [Life](../../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md)            |

You create a holy aura within 10 feet of you for the duration.

Creatures and any [Spells](../../../Spells.md) associated with the [Death](../../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) [Domain](../../../Spell%20Domains/Spell%20Domains.md) cannot enter the circle. If you move within 10 feet of them, they are magically pushed back, so they always remain just outside of the circle.

Any creatures that are level 5 or higher can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) to resist this spell. They are able to cross the boundary without being pushed back.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
