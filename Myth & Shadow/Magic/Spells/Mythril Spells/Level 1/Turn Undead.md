You create an holy aura in a 30 foot radius around you. 

Any undead creatures in that area are pushed back 30 feet and fall [Prone](../../../../Conditions/Prone.md). 

If a creature is less than half your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) rounded down, it is destroyed instantly.

If a creature is greater than your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), is makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
