You create an holy aura within 30 feet of you.

Any undead creatures in that area will take 3d12 [Holy](../../../../Damage%20Types/Holy.md) damage if they end their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) in the aura.

If the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than or equal to this [Spell's Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md), the aura destroys it instantly.

If a creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) greater than your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), is makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
