You create an holy aura within 30 feet of you. 

Any undead creatures in that area are pushed back 30 feet, fall [Prone](../../../../Conditions/Prone.md), and are [Dazed](../../../../Conditions/Dazed.md) until your next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md).

If the creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) is less than or equal to this [Spell's Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md), it is destroyed instantly.

If a creature's [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) greater than your [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md), is makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.
