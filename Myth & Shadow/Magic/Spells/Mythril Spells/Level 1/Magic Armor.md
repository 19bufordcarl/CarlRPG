For the duration, you are protected by a magical forcefield. This forcefield has 5 [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md). When you would take damage, you may have the forcefield take that damage instead. When it is reduced to 0 HP it is dispelled, and any excess damage is dealt to you.

*Upcast: Increase the forcefield's HP by 1 per spell level.*
