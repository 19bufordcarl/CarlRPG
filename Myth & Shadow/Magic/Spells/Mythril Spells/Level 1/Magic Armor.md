For the duration, you are protected by a magical forcefield. Your [Armor X Property](../../../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md) becomes 14. If you already have that property from worn [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md), this spell has no effect.
