You touch one creature imbuing it with vigor, it regains 1d6 + your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) in [Fatigue Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md).

This spell does not heal [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) at all, nor [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).

*Upcast: You heal an additional 1d6 HP per spell level.*
