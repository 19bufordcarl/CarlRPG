You touch one creature, imbuing it with vigor, it restores [Fatigue Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to 1d6 + your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md).

This spell also [Stabilizes](../../../../Conditions/Stabilized.md) creatures who are [Dying](../../../../Conditions/Dying.md).

*(This spell does not heal [HP](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) at all, nor [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).)*

*Upcast: Restore an additional 1d6 FP per spell level.*
