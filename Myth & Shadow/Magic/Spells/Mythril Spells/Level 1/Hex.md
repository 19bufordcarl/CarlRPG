You place a simple curse on a creature you can see within range. Whenever it takes damage, it takes an additional 1 [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.

This damage cannot be [Resisted](../../../../Conditions/Resistant.md). ([Immune](../../../../Conditions/Immune.md) creatures are still unaffected).

*Upcast: The creature takes an additional 1 damage per spell level.*
