You can select a number of creatures within range equal to your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md). Those creatures fall asleep and are [Unconscious](../../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) for the duration if they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 2 or lower. Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30 feet per spell level.*
