You imbue an object with a brilliant, heatless light equivalent to a torch for a duration of 1 hour, equivalent to 6 [Delving](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md) turns.

Alternatively, if you are within 5' of a creature, you can attempt to blind it by casting light on it's eyes. It must make a [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to your [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, it is [Blinded](../../../../Conditions/Blinded.md).

*Upcast: The light defeats higher level [Darkness](../Level%202/Darkness.md) spells at higher levels.*
