You reverse a basic healing ritual to disrupt the flow of life in a creature. The creature takes 2d4 + your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage. 

This damage cannot be [Resisted](../../../../Conditions/Resistant.md). ([Immune](../../../../Conditions/Immune.md) creatures are still unaffected).

*Upcast: You deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
