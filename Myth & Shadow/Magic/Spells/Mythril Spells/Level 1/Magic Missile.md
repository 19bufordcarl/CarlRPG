You shoot a magical bolt of energy at a target that deals 1d4 + 1 [Mythril Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md). The bolt bends around corners if necessary, it always hits.

This means you only need to be able to see a sliver of the target rather than the normal line of sight rules for [Spell Projectiles](../../../Spellcasting.md#Spell%20Range).

*Upcast: Shoot one additional missile per spell level.*
