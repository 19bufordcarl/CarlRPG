You breathe out and create a toxic cloud affecting all creatures, except you, within 5 feet of you. 

Affected creatures must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, that creature gains [Poisoned 1](../../../../Conditions/Poisoned.md).

*Upcast: Deal 1 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
