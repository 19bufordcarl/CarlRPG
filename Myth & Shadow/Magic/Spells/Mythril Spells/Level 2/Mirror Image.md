You create illusions (images) that look exactly like you. You can create a number of images equal to [Half](../../../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) (minimum 1). Whenever you would be dealt damage, the damage hits one of your images instead, which dissipates harmlessly. 

The spell ends once all the images are gone.
