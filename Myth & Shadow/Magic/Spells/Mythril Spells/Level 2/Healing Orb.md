You imbue rapid healing energy into a glowing orb which you send to a creature.

You choose 1 creature you can see within range. They restore [Health Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) equal to your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md).

(*Any additional healing then applies to the creature's [Fatigue Points](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md).* *This spell can only heal mortal creatures. This spell does not heal [Scars](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).*)

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30 feet per spell level.*
