You touch one weapon, imbuing with the magically ability to hone in on a target's weakness. The weapon deals [Mythril Damage](../../../../Damage%20Types/Mythril%20Damage.md) and gains the [Deadly Property](../../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Deadly%20Property.md) for the duration.
