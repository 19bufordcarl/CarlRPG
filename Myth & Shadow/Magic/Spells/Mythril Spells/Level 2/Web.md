You create a 30' cube of sticky web within range. Any creatures in the affected area must make a [Strength](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to your [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, they are [Restrained](../../../../Conditions/Restrained.md). On a success, they break free. They may repeat this [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md).

*Upcast: Range increases by 30' per spell level.*
