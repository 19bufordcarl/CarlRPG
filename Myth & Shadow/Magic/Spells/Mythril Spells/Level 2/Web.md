You create a sticky web on a point you can see within range, affecting all creatures within 15 feet of that point. Affected creatures make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
