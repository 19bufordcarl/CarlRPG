You create a sticky web on a point you can see within range, affecting all creatures within 15 feet of that point. Affected creatures make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Strength](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
- On a failure, they are [Restrained](../../../../Conditions/Restrained.md). 
- On a success, they break free.
- They may break free as an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md).

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
