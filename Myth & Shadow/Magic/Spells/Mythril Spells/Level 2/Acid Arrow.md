An especially corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see in range dealing 1d12 [Acid](../../../../Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage.

Reduce the [Armor Class](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) of that creature by 2.

- If they are wearing [Mundane](../../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Mundane%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Armor.md), it is permanently damaged.
- [Silvered](../../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Armor.md) is only damaged until the acid is washed off with water.
- [Mythril](../../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Armor.md) is undamaged by this spell

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d12 damage per spell level.*
