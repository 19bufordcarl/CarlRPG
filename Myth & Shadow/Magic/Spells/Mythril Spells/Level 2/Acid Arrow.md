An especially corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see in range. It takes 2d4 [Acid](../../../../Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage. Whatever damage reduction that creature has is reduced by 1.

If the damage reduction came from an [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) set, that [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) set is permanently damaged. [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) of elven quality or higher is only damaged until the acid is washed off with water.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
