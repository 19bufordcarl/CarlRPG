An especially corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see in range dealing 2d4 [Acid](../../../../Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage.

Reduce the [Armor X Property](../../../../Items/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md) of that creature's worn armor by 2.
- If this is [Mundane](../../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Mundane%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Armor.md), it is permanently damaged. 
- [Silvered](../../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Armor.md) is only damaged until the acid is washed off with water. 
- [Mythril](../../../../Items/Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Armor.md) is undamaged by this spell
