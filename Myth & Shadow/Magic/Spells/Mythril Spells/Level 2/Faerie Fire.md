You create a 10 foot cube on a point you can see within range. Bright purplish pink magical dust encompasses that cube, revealing all invisible items and creatures in the cube, as well as granted [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on [Attacks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) against affected creatures.

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' and the cube size by 10'.*
