You magically open a portal (door, gate, etc.) through all mundane locks or barriers, or a [Hold Portal](../Level%201/Hold%20Portal.md) spell of a lower [Spell Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md).  This creates a thunderous 'knock' noise audible out several hundred feet.

*Upcast: Defeats higher level held portals.*
