# Detect Thoughts

| Level    | 2 #Spell2                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Casting  | 1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) |
| Duration | 1 hour ([Concentration](../../../Concentration.md)) |
| Range    | 30 feet                                             |
| Domains  | [Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md)          |

For the duration, you gain the ability to peer into the mind of creatures you can see within range. Each [Combat](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md) [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) you can learn one target's immediate thoughts. The target then makes a [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to your last [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a success, the target notices your mental intrusion, then the spell ends. 

*Upcast: The referee can give you deeper level thoughts appropriate to the spell level.*
