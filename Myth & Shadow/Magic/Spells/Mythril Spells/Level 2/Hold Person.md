You choose 1 target humanoid ([Ancestry](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) you can see within range. If they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 4 or less, they are [Paralyzed](../../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md). They make a [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to your [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) at the *end* of their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). On a success, they cease being [Paralyzed](../../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md).

*Upcast: You can paralyze targets with 1 additional wisdom per spell level.*
