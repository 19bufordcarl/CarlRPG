## Erevantheâ€™s Banes
- If you fail a [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) check made with [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md), you take [Necrotic](../../../../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage equal to the [Spell's Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md).

- Leaving Erevanthe's faith grants you the cursed tongue of a heretic.
	- Your [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

## Erevanthe's Ethos
Queen of shadows, secrets, and the power of words not said. The power between true and false, light and shadow, good and evil. The ashen [Infernals](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Infernals.md) claim her as the founder of their culture and the one responsible for their 'blessed' forms.

Erevanthe expects strict devotion from her followers, obedience is valued above all, shadows and secrets hold the keys to power, she knows all, and you need to know not.
