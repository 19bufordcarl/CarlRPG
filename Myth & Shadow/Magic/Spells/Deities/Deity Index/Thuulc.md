# Thuulc
**You must have at least 3 [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) to follow Thuulc.**
## Thuulc's Boons
### Altered Spellcasting
For [Spells](../../../Spells.md) that share one of the [Thuulc's Domains](Thuulc%20Template.md#Thuulc's%20Domains):
- No difference, [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) is the default ability score for spells.
### Unique Boon
For life domain deities
### Thuulc's Domains
- Element(s)
- Energy(s)
## Thuulc's Banes
### Limited Spells
You cannot memorize or cast spells that do not share one of [Thuulc's Domains](Thuulc%20Template.md#Thuulc's%20Domains).
### Heresy
Leaving Thuulc's faith grants you the cursed =feature= of a heretic.
- Your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
- Should only apply to death domain deities
