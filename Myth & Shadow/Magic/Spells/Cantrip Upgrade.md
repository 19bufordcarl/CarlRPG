# Cantrip Upgrade

[Cantrips](Spells%20by%20Level/Cantrips/{Cantrips}.md) cannot be upcast like normal [Spells](../Spells.md).

Instead, cantrips upgrade when you get to higher [Arcana](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Primary%20Skills/Arcana.md) [Proficiency](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Skills.md#Proficiency) tiers.

## Cantrip Upcast

You can choose to upcast a cantrip if you so desire. Normal [Upcast](Spell%20Attributes.md#Upcast) rules apply. You get one cantrip upgrade tier per spell level you use. This stacks with your normal cantrip upgrade.
