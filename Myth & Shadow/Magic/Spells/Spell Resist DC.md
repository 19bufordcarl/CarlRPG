# Spell Resist DC

Sometimes, a [Spell](../Spells.md) requires the caster to make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target's Spell Resist DC. This special [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/DC.md) must specify one of the three [Attribute Scores](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md).

An NPC's Spell Resist DC is equal to:

8 + [Attribute Score](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Attribute%20Scores.md) + ([Max Proficiency Bonus](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Skills.md#Max%20Proficiency%20Bonus) if this is the target's [Highest Attribute](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Highest%20Attribute.md))
