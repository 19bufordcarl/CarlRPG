# Spell Attributes

## Spell Level

The [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) represents the 'power level' of a spell.

## Spell Domain

Every spell has a list of [Spell Domains](Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) that represents the forces of magic from which the spell draws its power. Your [Known Spells](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md) must share one of your [Learned Domains](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md).

## Casting Time

Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under *Casting*. It is usually 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

## Duration

All [Spells](../Spells.md) have a specified duration. The spell's effect lasts *for the duration*.

[Spells](../Spells.md) with a duration of *None* simply apply their effect once and then end.

Most [Spells](../Spells.md) require [Concentration](Concentration.md) for their duration to continue.

## Spell Range

You must be able to clearly see the target of your spell and they must be in range.

Touch spells can only be cast on creatures who you are [Engaged](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with.

[Spells](../Spells.md) with multiple targets apply relevant spell text to all affected targets.

*Note: [Spells](../Spells.md) that shoot projectiles at targets do not make a [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md).*

## Upcast

If you want to make a spell more powerful, you can use an amount of [Mythril](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md) powder required to cast a higher [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md), and gain the upcast benefits listed in the spell text. The Spell Level is treated as whatever you upcasted it to for the purposes of [Spellcasting](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md).

The level at which you upcast a spell cannot exceed your [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

Any spells that would do [Tier 1](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) damage deal [Tier 2](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) damage instead when upcast.
