# Spell Attributes

## Spell Level

The [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) represents the 'power level' of a spell.

## Casting Time

Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under *Casting*. It is usually 1 [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

## Duration

All [Spells](../Spells.md) have a specified duration. The spell's effect lasts *for the duration*.

[Spells](../Spells.md) with a duration of *None* simply apply their effect once and then end.

Many [Spells](../Spells.md) require [Concentration](Concentration.md) for their duration to continue.

## Spell Range

You must be able to clearly see the target of your spell and they must be in range.

Touch spells can only be cast on creatures who you are [Engaged](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with.

[Spells](../Spells.md) with multiple targets apply relevant spell text to all affected targets.

*Note: [Spells](../Spells.md) that shoot projectiles at targets do not make a [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md).*

## Spell Resist and Save

Some [Spells](../Spells.md) require the caster to make a [Spellcasting Check](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Check.md) against the target(s)'s [Spell Resist DC](Spell%20Resist%20DC.md) or the target to make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against the caster's [Spell Save DC](Spell%20Save%20DC.md).

## Upcast

If you want to make a spell more powerful, you must use the amount of [Mythril](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md) powder and [Magicka Point Cost](../Spellcasting/Magicka%20Point%20Cost.md) required to cast a higher [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md). If you do, you gain the upcast benefits listed in the spell text. This becomes the Spell Level for this instance of the spell casting.

The level at which you upcast a spell cannot exceed your [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

Any spells that would do [Tier 1](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%201.md) damage deal [Tier 2](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Damage/Damage%20Tiers/Tier%202.md) damage instead when upcast.
