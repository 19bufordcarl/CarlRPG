# Resist

Some [Spells](../Spells.md) allow an affected target to make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist their magic.

When the target succeeds the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist, the spell ends for them.

Targets may attempt to resist a spell multiple times.
