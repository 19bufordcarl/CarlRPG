# Resist

Some [Spells](../Spells.md) allow an affected target to make a [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist their magic.

When the target succeeds the [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist, the spell ends for them.

Once a target has resisted a given instance of a spell, it cannot affect that target again.

By default, the GM uses the average roll for NPC resist checks. The GM may choose to roll instead if the creature would always succeed.

The average roll is 10 + the relevant defense.
