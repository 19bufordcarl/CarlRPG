# Area of Effect (AOE)

Spells with a designated AOE apply some portion of their spell text to all creatures in the affected area. There are two types of area of effect.

## Aura

An aura is the default term for an area of effect. The term is specifically non-geometrical so that it can apply to whatever method you use to represent the geometry of your game. All examples will use a 15 foot aura effect.

### Measurement (Default)
In a measurement system, a spell that "creates a 15 foot aura on a point you can see within range" creates a sphere with a 15 foot radius whose origin is the chosen point. Creatures within 15 feet are 

## Cubes

If playing on a square grid, it is recommended to use chess king movement as opposed to Euclidean geometry. Since a diagonal is the same distance as a non-diagonal in this system, that means that spheres are abstracted to be cubes, hence why everything is cube.

### Geometry Note

Any AOE that has square as the epicenter would correlated to an cube size ending in 5 (5', 15', 25', etc.) A 5' cube is equivalent to just your square, and so isn't used. If a spell states, "within 15 feet of (a point)", that point is taken to be the intersection point of 4 squares. This equates to a 30 foot (30') cube centered on that intersection. If the spell states "within 30 feet of (caster)", then this equates to a 65 foot cube centered on the caster. For ease of language and compatibility with other measurement systems, within X feet is always the specification. It make measurement much easier and less finicky to decide which creatures can and can't be affected.

## Line

If playing on a square grid then you draw any straight line. According to the width specified, any squares within the specified width are considered affected area..

## Measurement System

If playing with a classic measurement system (typically 5' in game = 1" on the board) then you can use spheres instead of cubes, everything is given in radius anyways to make this easy.

## Abstract

If playing with abstract distances, it is recommended to use zones of 30 feet (roughly 6 inches in real space if using minis, roughly the length of a pen). A spell with a 5 foot radius should affect all creatures in melee range of the target. A spell with a 30 foot radius should affect all creatures within movement range of the target. If it is a 15 foot radius, it can affect [Half](../../../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) the creatures within movement range of the target.
