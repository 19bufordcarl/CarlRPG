# Deities

A *Patron Deity* helps you avoid bad luck by getting [Reroll Tokens](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md) through [Praying](Deities.md#Praying).

A PC can swear faith to a Deity at [New Player Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md), or over [Downtime](../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) by visiting an appropriate [Temple](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Temple.md). This is called their *Patron Deity*.

The Deities vary based on the setting â€” see [Pantheons of Mithrinia](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Pantheons%20of%20Mithrinia.md).

## Praying

A PC can take time to pray to their *Patron Deity* over a [Delve Round](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to gain a [Reroll Token](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md).

After doing so, they roll a d6 and subtract the number of [Spell Domains](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) their Deity has. If the result is a 1 or less, they cannot benefit from praying for the rest of this session.

## Deity Spell Domains

The player and GM decide what [Spell Domains](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) would make the most sense for a given Deity to have. A Deity can have at most 4 of the 6 domains.

As a follower of a Deity, you may only [Cast](Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) spells that share one of the Deity's domains. If you cast a spell outside their domain, you are marked as a heretic and the Deity resents you.

If you do anything in game that would be against your Deity's beliefs or practices, you are also marked as a heretic and the Deity resents you.

*Usually, a Deity has one of [The Elements](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md#The%20Elements) and one of [The Energies](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md#The%20Energies) as its domains.*
