# Deities

A PC can swear faith to a Deity at [New Player Character Creation](../../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md), or over [Downtime](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting an appropriate [Temple](../Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md). A patron Deity is required for certain [Spells](../../Magic/Spells.md).

Deities usually have somewhere between 1 to 3 [Spell Domains](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md). As a follower of a Deity, you can only [Spell Memorization](Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) or [Spellcasting](Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) spells that share one of the Deity's domains. If you cast a spell outside their domain, you are marked as a heretic and the Deity resents you.

The precise Deities available are defined by the setting. Every Deity belongs to a [Pantheon](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Pantheons%20of%20Mithrinia.md).

*Optional*
The GM may allow PCs to complete quests to do penance for a Deity that resents them.
