# Deities

A *Patron Deity* helps you avoid bad luck by getting [Reroll Tokens](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md) through [Praying](Deities.md#Praying).

A PC can swear faith to a Deity at [Player Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/Player%20Character%20Creation.md), or over [Downtime](../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) by visiting an appropriate [Temple](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Temple.md). This is called their *Patron Deity*.

The Deities vary based on the setting â€” see [Pantheons of Mithrinia](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Pantheons%20of%20Mithrinia.md).

## Praying

A PC can take a [Break](../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Break.md) to pray to their *Patron Deity*, which grants them a [Reroll Token](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Reroll%20Tokens.md).

After doing so, they roll their [Prayer Die](Deities.md#Prayer%20Die) and add the total their *Divine Counter*.

When this counter reaches 20, the PC's luck has run dry:

1. They cannot benefit from *Praying* again until they roll a [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md).
2. When they do roll that [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Success.md), it is treated as a [Critical Failure](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Failure.md).
	- *This cannot be avoided by any means.*

Afterwards, the counter resets to 0, and their [Prayer Die](Deities.md#Prayer%20Die) decreases by 1 size.

### Prayer Die

Every time you reset your *Divine Counter*, your *Prayer Die* decreases by 1 size.

| Die | Number of Resets |
| --: | ---------------: |
| d20 |                0 |
| d12 |                1 |
| d10 |                2 |
|  d8 |                3 |
|  d6 |                4 |
|  d4 |               5+ |

## Deity Beliefs

The player and GM decide what the rituals and practices that a follower of a given Deity would have. If the PC ever violates the beliefs of the Deity in a significant, deliberate manner, they are forsaken by the Deity and gain no further benefits from [Praying](Deities.md#Praying) to that Deity.
