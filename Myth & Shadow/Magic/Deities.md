# Deities

A PC can swear faith to a Deity at [New Player Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md), or over [Downtime](../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md) by visiting an appropriate [Temple](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Temple.md). A Patron Deity is required to safely cast certain [Spells](Spells.md).

The precise Deities and available are defined by the setting â€” see [Pantheons of Mithrinia](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Pantheons%20of%20Mithrinia.md).

## Choosing Domains

The player and GM decide what domains would make the most sense for a given Deity. By default, a Deity has one of [The Elements](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md#The%20Elements) and one of [The Energies](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md#The%20Energies) as its domains.

As a follower of a Deity, you may only [Cast](Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) spells that share one of the Deity's domains. If you cast a spell outside their domain, you are marked as a heretic and the Deity resents you.

### Limiting to One Domain

If a PC worships a Deity with a single domain, they may gain [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Advantage.md) on casting one [Spell](Spells.md) of their choice. They may change which spell when they [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

### Expanding Domains

If a PC worships a Deity with more domains than the default two, there should be some narrative cost to worshipping this Deity, perhaps it is outside the orthodoxy and hard to find faithful temples, or perhaps the faith's practices are especially strict and demanding.
