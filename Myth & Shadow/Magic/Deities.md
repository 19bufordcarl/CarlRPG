# Deities

A PC can swear faith to a Deity at [New Player Character Creation](../Character%20Creation/New%20Player%20Character%20Creation.md), or over [Downtime](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting an appropriate [Temple](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Price%20Subtables/Holy%20Temple.md). A Patron Deity is required to safely cast certain [Spells](Spells.md).

Deities usually have either one or two [Spell Domains](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md). *See [Choosing Domains](Deities.md#Choosing%20Domains)*. As a follower of a Deity, you can only [Memorize](Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Memorization.md) or [Cast](Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) spells that share one of the Deity's domains. If you cast a spell outside their domain, you are marked as a heretic and the Deity resents you.

The precise Deities available are defined by the setting. Every Deity belongs to a [Pantheon](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Mithrinian%20Pantheons/Pantheons%20of%20Mithrinia.md).

The GM may allow PCs to complete quests to do penance for a Deity that resents them.

## Choosing Domains

The player and GM decide what domains would make the most sense for a given Deity. By default, a Deity has one of [The Elements](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md#The%20Elements) and one of [The Energies](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md#The%20Energies) as its domains.

### Limiting to One Domain

If a PC worships a Deity with a single domain, they may learn new [Spells](Spells.md) and [Spell Domains](Spells/Spell%20Domains/{Spell%20Domains}.md) for half the normal cost if they are [Magical Apprentice](Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Magical%20Apprentice.md) of that Deity's temple.

### Expanding Domains

If a PC worships a Deity with more domains than the default two, there should be some narrative cost to worshipping this Deity, perhaps it is outside the orthodoxy and hard to find faithful temples, or perhaps the faith's practices are especially strict and demanding.
