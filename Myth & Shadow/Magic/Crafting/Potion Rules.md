# Potion Rules

## Using Potions

There are many ways that you can use a magical potion.

### Drinking

You may drink **one** potion on your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) as a [Free Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Free%20Action).

Any subsequent potions you drink cost an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

### Force Feed

You may use an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to attempt to force a creature [Engaged](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you to drink the potion.

A creature may choose to resist this attempt. If they do, you must make a successful [Melee Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Melee%20Attack.md) against their [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) to force feed them the potion.

### Throwing

You may use a potion as an [Improvised Ranged Weapon](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md#Improvised%20Ranged%20Weapons).

If you do, the spell contained in the potion must target its container when it breaks.

If you miss this [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md), the potion lands just below the target instead of on it.

If you roll a [Critical Miss](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md), the potion hits another target within range chosen at random. If there are no other legal targets, it slips out of your hand and hits you.

## Storing Potions

Every [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) is assumed to come with a potion belt. This lets you have access to a large number of potions and oils, and is generally not worth tracking.

Any potions and oils exceeding you first few dozen will need to go in your [Stash](../../Player%20Characters/Inventory/Stash.md).

## Enhanced Brewing

Provided it is within your [Max Spell Level](../Spells/Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level), you can "upcast" the [Spells](../Spells.md) stored in your potions.

Each level you upcast increases the [Mythril](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md) requirement by a multiplier of 4.
