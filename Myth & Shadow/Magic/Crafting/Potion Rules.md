# Potion Rules

## Using Potions

There are many ways that you can use a magical potion.

### Drinking

You may drink **one** potion on your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) as a [Free Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Free%20Action).

Any subsequent potions you drink cost an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

### Force Feed

You may use an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to attempt to force a creature [Engaged](../../Game%20Procedures/Conditions/Engaged.md) with you to drink the potion.

A creature may choose to resist this attempt. If they do, you must make a successful [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Strength.md) or [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Dexterity.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Check.md) against their [AC](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) to force feed them the potion.

### Throwing

You may use a potion as an [Improvised Ranged Weapon](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md#Improvised%20Ranged%20Weapons).

If you do, the spell contained in the potion must target its container when it breaks.

If you miss this [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md), the potion lands just below the target instead of on it.

If you roll a [Critical Miss](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md), the potion hits another target within range chosen at random. If there are no other legal targets, it slips out of your hand and hits you.
