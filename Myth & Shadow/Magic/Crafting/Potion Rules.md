# Potion Rules

## Using Potions

There are many ways that you can use a magical potion.

### Drinking

You may drink one potion on your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) as a [Free Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md#Free%20Action).

Any subsequent potions you drink cost an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

### Throwing

You may use a potion as an [Improvised Ranged Weapon](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md#Improvised%20Ranged%20Weapons).

If you do, the spell contained in the potion must target its container when it breaks.

If you miss this [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md), the potion lands at the targets feet instead of on it.

If you roll a [Critical Miss](../../Game%20Procedures/Die%20Rolling%20Mechanics/Critical%20Miss.md), the potion hits another target within range chosen at random. If there are no other suitable target, it slipped out of your hand and hits you.
