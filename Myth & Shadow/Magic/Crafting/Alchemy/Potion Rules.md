# Potion Rules

See [Alchemy](Alchemy.md) for the creation procedure of potions.

## Range

Potions use the range of the imbued effect (usually a [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md)) to determine target(s) affected.

*Potions can be thrown as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Ranged%20Attack.md).*

### Self

These potions must be drunk.

### Touch or Target

These potions can either be drunk or coat their target.

### AOE

These potions explode in the prescribed AOE when uncorked, broken, etc.

The brewer can choose exactly how the AOE is applied.

*Example: A PC brews a potion of [Burning Hands](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%201/Burning%20Hands.md). They can choose to have the AOE apply when the potion is consumed and the consumer belches out a gout of flames. The flavor is up to the PC for AOE spells as long as the ranges are not changed.*

## Action Economy

Using a potion takes an [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md).

## Potion FAQs

- Each potion takes up 1 [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).
- You don't need to make a [Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for potions that list a spell as their effect.
- If the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)))*
- If the spell requires [Concentration](../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md), the potion does not.
- The spell's duration is the same as it would normally be.
- Potions benefit from [Upcast](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.
- As a general rule of thumb, effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed or coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect.
	- Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect.
	- This means potions cannot be shared (unless they have an AOE range).
- You can 'reduce' the range of potion, but you cannot increase it.
	- AOE can become target or self, but not the other way around.

## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling potions is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, PCs can buy them for double the creation cost and sell for half.
