# Alchemy

You can only brew potions using [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that you have [Memorized](../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Memorization.md).

See [Potion Rules](Potion%20Rules.md) for how these items can be used once made.

## True Brewing Procedure

True brewing creates potions with no expiration date. It requires:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) *and* it's score is at least 7.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) is at least 10.
2. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
3. 100x the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) for the potion.
4. Purified water (an [Alchemist Kit](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) is required to achieve purification).
5. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
6. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell!
	1. The brewing process takes one full day *per [Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)*, succeed or fail.
		1. You can do no other meaningful activities that day.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril and yields bad water.
	3. You **cannot** benefit from a [Full Rest](../../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) during days spent brewing.

*Note: Potions are VERY DIFFERENT from [Elixirs](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Procedures/Alchemy%20Based%20Spellcasting.md)*.
