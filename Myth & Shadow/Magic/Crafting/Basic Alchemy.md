# Basic Alchemy

Unlike the more complex [Crafting Magic Items](Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md) which can create powerful potions of any spell that always work, basic alchemy allows a skilled PC to create fickle potions.

## Brewing Potions

Basic alchemy requires:

1. A [Glass Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md) and [Alchemist Kit](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar.
2. A [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to brew.
3. The *Brewer* imbues a [Known Spell](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md) into a potion, consuming the required [Mythril](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md).

## Using Potions

You may forego your [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Movement.md) *or* [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md) to drink a potion.

When the potion is drunk, the *Brewer* makes [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for the spell and speaks the incantation to activate the magic. This takes them an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md). On a success, the spell takes effect for the creature that drunk the potion.

When a potion is unsealed or broken, the *Brewer* may make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for the spell and speaks the incantation to activate the magic. This takes them an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md). The spell is treated as a normal except you can only choose potion vial as the target for the spell.

In order to use a potion in [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Combat.md), the *Brewer* must [Ready](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Reaction.md#Ready) their [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to be prepared for when the potion is used, unless it is used on their [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Turn.md).

## Carrying Potions

Potions are delicate to store properly, each one takes up an [Equipment Slot](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Equipment%20Slot.md).
