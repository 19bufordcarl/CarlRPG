# Basic Alchemy

Unlike the more complex [Crafting Magic Items](Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md) which can create powerful potions of any spell that never expire, basic alchemy allows a skilled PC to create certain magical effects.

All basic alchemy requires:

1. A [Glass Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md) and [Alchemist Kit](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar.
2. A [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to brew.
3. A [Spell](../Spellcasting/Spells.md) capable of targeting a creature.

You imbue the spell into a potion. When the potion is drunk, the brewer must make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for the potion's spell and speak the words to activate the magic, using an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md). On a success, the spell takes effect for the creature that drunk the potion.

Spells with an [AOE](../Spells/Areas%20of%20Effect/{AOE}%20Area%20of%20Effect.md) can take effect when their vial is unsealed or broken. The brewer still must make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) or the potion fizzles.
