# Basic Alchemy

Unlike the more complex [Crafting Magic Items](Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md) which can create powerful potions of any spell that always work, basic alchemy allows a skilled PC to create simple potions.

Depending on your [Known Spells](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md), you can craft the following:

1. [Acid Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Acid%20Vial.md)
2. [Alchemist Fire](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Alchemist%20Fire.md)
3. [Healing Potion](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Healing%20Potion.md)
4. [Pure Water Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Pure%20Water%20Vial.md)

For how to use potions, see [Potion Rules](Potion%20Rules.md).

## Weapon Oils

Alternatively, you can use the [Survival](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Survival.md) or [Arcana](../../Player%20Characters/Skills/Arcana.md) skills learn how to craft [Weapon Oils](Weapon%20Oils.md).

## Carrying Potions

Potions and oils can be stored for free in your [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) in the potion belt.
