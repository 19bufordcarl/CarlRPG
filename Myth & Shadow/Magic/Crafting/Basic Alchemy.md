# Basic Alchemy

Unlike the more complex [Crafting Magic Items](Crafting%20Magic%20Items.md) which can create powerful potions of any spell that always work, basic alchemy allows a skilled PC to create simple potions.

Depending on your [Learned Domains](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md), you can craft the following.

1. [Acid Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Acid%20Vial.md) ([Earth](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md))
2. [Alchemist Fire](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/1000%20Coins/Alchemist%20Fire.md) ([Fire](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md))
3. [Antidote](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Antidote.md) ([Life](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md), [Earth](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md), [Water](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md))
4. [Pure Water Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/250%20Coins/Pure%20Water%20Vial.md) ([Life](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Life.md), [Water](../Spells/Spell%20Domains/Water.md))

## Weapon Oils

Alternatively, you can use a [Learned Domains](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md) to learn how to craft [Weapon Oils](Weapon%20Oils.md).

## Carrying Potions

Potions and oils are delicate to store properly, each one takes up an [Equipment Slot](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Equipment%20Slot.md).
