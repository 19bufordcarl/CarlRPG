# Enchanting Procedures

There are two main types of enchantments

## Charged Enchants

These enchantments, available to PCs ~6th [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) or higher, store spells as charges in items.

## Passive Enchants

These enchantments, available to PCs ~7th [Level](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) or higher, apply a spell passively to the wielder.

## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, buy for double the creation cost and sell for half. Hard to fence, hard to get.
