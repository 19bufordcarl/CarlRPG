# Charged Spells

You can only make these enchantments using [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that you have [Memorized](../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Memorization.md).

## Crafting Charged Spells

The crafting process requires access to the appropriate arcane equipment and:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) *and* it's score is at least 7.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) is at least 9.
2. A [Silvered](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) item.
	1. [Silvered](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. 200x the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) for the enchantment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process takes one week *per [Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)* succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.

## Using Charged Spells

1. A charge can be used as an [Action](../../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md), causing the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) to take effect.
	1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
		1. If the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell. *Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../../Spells/Spell%20Level.md)))*
	2. If the spell requires [Concentration](../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md), the charge does too.
2. Enchantments can benefit from [Upcast](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Recharging

Charges do **NOT** replenish automatically. You must imbue the item with the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required again. However, since the magic is already bound to the item, you do not need to make another [Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), nor do you need access to arcane equipment. Recharging takes 1 hour of uninterrupted focus per charge replenished.
