# Passive Spells

You can only make these enchantments using [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) that you have [Memorized](../../Spellcasting/Spell%20Memorization.md).

## Crafting Passive Spells

The crafting process requires access to the appropriate arcane equipment and:

1. Your [Favored Ability](../../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Favored%20Ability.md) to be your [Spellcasting Ability](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) *and* it's score is at least 8.
	1. *Or* your [Spellcasting Ability](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Disciplines/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) is at least 10.
2. A [Silvered](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) item.
	1. [Silvered](../../../Items%20and%20Gear/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) items can only hold up to [2nd Level Spells](../../Spells/Spells%20by%20Level/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md).
3. 10,000x the [Mythril](../../Mythril.md) required to [Cast](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md) the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) for the enchantment.
4. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md).
5. On a success, you have successfully enchanted the magic item!
	1. The enchanting process generally takes a month per spell level succeed or fail.
	2. A failure consumes all Mythril, but does not ruin the item.

## Passive Enchantments

### Using Passives

1. Passive enchantment [Spells](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) are subject to the following restrictions and modifications.
	1. Prerequisite: You can only passively enchant spells with a duration. *(cannot be 'None')*
	2. Target: You must be capable of targeting a [Humanoid](../../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) with the spell.
	3. Range: The spell's range is ignored, it only applies the [Spell](../../Spellcasting/Spells.md) to the wielder.
		- *No [Concentration](../../Spellcasting/Concentration.md) is required.*
2. Enchantments benefit from [Upcast](../../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#Upcast) effects.

## Alternative Effects

Players may wish to create a passive item that does not model a spell exactly. Perhaps it is inspired by a spell but stronger, or perhaps they want to make a more specialized version with some drawback or curse to reduce the cost of the enchantment. Between the player and the GM, decide which category the alternative effect falls into.

| Alternative Effect            | Mythril Cost Modification |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------: |
| Debilitating drawback / curse |               - (40+d10)% |
| Frustrating drawback          |               - (20+d10)% |
| Annoying drawback             |               - (10+d10)% |
| Roughly equivalent            |          +/- (2d10 - 10)% |
| Minor improvement             |               + (20+d10)% |
| Major improvement             |                 + (d100)% |
| Insane improvement            |          Requires a Quest |
