# Weapon Oils

## Crafting Weapon Oils

The crafting process requires:

1. A PC of an appropriate [Background](../../Player%20Characters/Backgrounds/Background.md). (Dex, Int, or Wis)
2. A sterile container, usually a [Glass Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md).
	1. Purified water and the [Mythril](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md) powder required.
	2. An [Alchemist Kit](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar is required to achieve purification.
3. A [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to prepare the oil.

A PC may apply a weapon oil as part of their [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) action. The oil's effect applies for that attack and that attack only.
