# Weapon Oils

## Crafting Weapon Oils

A PC must learn this skill over [Downtime](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md). It counts as a [Learned Domain](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Learned%20Domains.md).

The crafting process requires:

1. A [Glass Vial](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/10%20Coins/Glass%20Vial.md) and [Alchemist Kit](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Gear/50%20Coins/Alchemist%20Kit.md) or similar.
2. A [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) to prepare the oil.
3. A trained PC.

## Using Weapon Oils

A PC may apply a weapon oil as part of their [Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md). The oil's effect applies only for that attack.
