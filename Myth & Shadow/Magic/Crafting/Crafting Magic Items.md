# Crafting Magic Items

PCs may attempt to craft magic items (potions, wands, etc.) once they are sufficiently high level.

In order to craft a magic item:

1. A PC must spend coins equal to the base value of that item as determined by the GM.
	1. The [XP](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) that magic item would grant if it were a treasure are used.
2. The PC's relevant [Ability Score](../../Player%20Characters/The%20Ability%20Scores/Ability%20Scores.md) must be a certain value.
3. A PC must have access to the relevant crafting apparatus.
4. Mythic items may require a special ingredient, determined by the GM.

| Rarity | Component Cost Range | Ability Score |
| ------ | -------------------: | ------------: |
| Normal |          <1000 coins |    at least 5 |
| Rare   |     1000-25000 coins |    at least 7 |
| Mythic |         25000+ coins |   at least 10 |

## Determining Magic Item Value

| Magic Item       | Price                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Single Use Spell | 5000 coins per spell level            |
| Charged Spell    | 5000 coins per spell level per charge |
| Passive Spell    | 5000 coins per spell level times 100  |
| Once per Turn    | 5000 coins per spell level times 50   |
| Thrice per Day   | 5000 coins per spell level times 30   |
| Once per Day     | 5000 coins per spell level times 10   |

*Note: 'Charges' do NOT replenish!*

## Weapon Oils
PCs can look into making [Weapon Oils](Weapon%20Oils.md). This is a simpler form of alchemy that modifies the [Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) of [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) in interesting ways,
## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, PCs can buy them for double the creation cost and sell them for half.
