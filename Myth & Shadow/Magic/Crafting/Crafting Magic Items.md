# Crafting Magic Items

PCs may attempt to craft magic items once they are sufficiently high level.

In order to craft a magic item:

1. A PC must have materials that are equivalent value to the item's value.
2. A PC must have the required [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).
3. A PC must have access to the relevant crafting apparatus.
4. Mythic items may require a special ingredient, determined by the GM.

|  Magic Item Value | Mental Defense |   Time |
| ----------------: | -------------: | -----: |
|      <1,000 coins |     at least 3 |  Hours |
| 1,000-5,000 coins |     at least 5 |   Days |
|      5,000+ coins |     at least 7 |  Weeks |
|         Priceless |    at least 10 | Months |

## Scrolls and Potions

The two most common magic items are "Scrolls" and Potions. They are both single use items.

A "Scroll" is any trinket grants a PC the ability to use the magic [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to cast a [Spell](../Spells.md) once without needing know it. It can also act as a [Spell Book](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Books.md) for that spell.

A Potion is a [Spell](../Spells.md) bottled up into a liquid vial. See [Potion Rules](Potion%20Rules.md).

## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the [Arcane Guild](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md), or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for.
