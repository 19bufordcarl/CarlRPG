# Crafting Magic Items

PCs may attempt to craft magic items (potions, wands, etc.) once they are sufficiently high level.

In order to craft a magic item:

1. A PC must have materials that are equivalent value to the item's value.
2. A PC must have the required [Mental Defense](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Mental%20Defense.md).
3. A PC must have access to the relevant crafting apparatus.
4. Mythic items may require a special ingredient, determined by the GM.

## Scrolls and Potions

The two most common magic items are "Scrolls" and Potions. They are both single use items.

A "Scroll" is any trinket that a PC can activate to cast a spell once without needing know it. It can also act as a [Spell Book](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Book.md) for that spell.

A Potion lets a PC drink it as an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to gain some special effect specified by the potion, usually it is essentially just a spell effect.

## Weapon Oils

PCs can look into making [Weapon Oils](Weapon%20Oils.md). This is a simpler form of alchemy that modifies the [Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) of [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) in interesting ways.

## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the [Arcane Guild](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md), or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for.
