# Crafting Magic Items

PCs may attempt to craft magic items once they are sufficiently high level.

In order to craft a magic item:

1. A PC must have materials of equivalent value to the item's value.
2. A PC must have the required [Magicka](../../Player%20Characters/Attributes/Magicka.md).
3. A PC must have access to the relevant crafting apparatus.
4. A PC must craft the item over a period of [Downtime](../../Game%20Procedures/Exploration/Downtime.md).
5. Priceless items may require a special ingredient, determined by the GM.

|  Magic Item Value |     Magicka |
| ----------------: | ----------: |
|      <1,000 coins |  at least 5 |
| 1,000-5,000 coins |  at least 8 |
|      5,000+ coins | at least 10 |
|         Priceless | at least 15 |

## Determining Magic Item Value

| Magic Item           |                                                                                               Price |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Single Use Spell     |               ([Mythril Resource Cost](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md#Mythril%20Resource%20Cost)) x 200 |
| Limited Use Spell    | ([Mythril Resource Cost](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md#Mythril%20Resource%20Cost)) x (# of Uses) x 200 |
| Passive Spell Effect |            ([Mythril Resource Cost](../Spellcasting/Mythril.md#Mythril%20Resource%20Cost)) x 20,000 |
| Mythril +1 Weapon    |                                                                                      +100,000 coins |
| Mythril +2 Weapon    |                                                                                      +500,000 coins |
| Mythril +1 Armor     |                                                                                      +200,000 coins |
| Mythril +2 Armor     |                                                                                    +1,000,000 coins |

## Scrolls and Potions

The two most common magic items are "Scrolls" and Potions. They are both single use items.

A "Scroll" is any trinket that grants a PC the ability to use the magic [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to cast a [Spell](../Spells.md) once without needing to make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll). It can also let a PC [Learn the Spell](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Known%20Spells.md#Spell%20Learning).

A Potion is a [Spell](../Spells.md) bottled up into a liquid vial. See [Potion Rules](Potion%20Rules.md).

## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the [Arcane Guild](../../Resources%20for%20GMs/Economy/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md), or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that the party does a lot of favors for.
