# Crafting Magic Items

PCs may attempt to craft magic items (potions, wands, etc.) once they are sufficiently high level.

In order to craft a magic item:

1. A PC must spend coins equal to the base value of that item as determined by the GM.
2. The PC's [Spellcasting Ability](../Spellcasting/Spellcasting%20Ability.md) for the spell to be crafted must be a certain value.
3. A PC must have access to the relevant crafting apparatus.
4. Mythic items may require a special ingredient, determined by the GM.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------: | ------------: | -----: |
| No XP                                                                                |         <1,000 coins |    at least 3 |  Hours |

## Determining Magic Item Value

| Magic Item           |                                     Price |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------: |
| Single Use Spell     |               (Spell Level) x 5,000 coins |
| Limited Use Spell    | (Spell Level) x (# of Uses) x 5,000 coins |
| Passive Spell Effect |       (Spell Level) x (100) x 5,000 coins |

## Weapon Oils

PCs can look into making [Weapon Oils](Weapon%20Oils.md). This is a simpler form of alchemy that modifies the [Attacks](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat/Attack.md) of [Weapons](../../Items%20and%20Gear/Weapons/Weapons.md) in interesting ways.

## Buying and Selling

In Mithrinia, buying and selling magic items is reserved for high ranking members of the arcane guild, or black market dealers. The GM ultimately decides the prices, and might give discounts for friendly factions that they party does a lot of favors for. Generally speaking, PCs can buy them for double the creation cost and sell them for half.

## Scrolls and Potions

The two most common magic items are scrolls and potions. They are both single use items.

A Scroll lets a PC activate the text without needing to know magic to cast a spell, and then the scroll disintegrates. It can also act as a [Spell Book](../Spellcasting/Spell%20Learning/Spell%20Book.md) for that spell.

A Potion lets a PC drink it as an [Action](../../Game%20Procedures/Core%20Procedures/Action.md) to gain some special effect specified by the potion, usually it is essentially just a spell effect.
