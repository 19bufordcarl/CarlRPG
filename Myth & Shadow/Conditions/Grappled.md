# Grappled
A grappled creature's [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) is 0, and it canâ€™t benefit from any bonus to movement.

If the grappler can no longer grappled the creature (out of melee reach, [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md), etc.) this condition ends.

*By default, melee reach is 5' (adjacent squares on a grid).*
