# Grappled

Your [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) becomes 0, and you can’t benefit from any bonus to your movement.

If the grappler can no longer grappled you (out of reach, [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md), etc.) this condition ends.

By default, a creature's reach is 5' (adjacent squares).
