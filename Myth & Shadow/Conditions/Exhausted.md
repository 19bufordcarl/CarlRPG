# Exhausted

While a creature is exhausted, its [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are set to 0 and cannot be restored.

Any damage it takes while exhausted causes it to fall [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).

The [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition is removed after a [Long Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
