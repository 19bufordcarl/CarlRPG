# Resistant

If a creature is resistant to a [Damage Type](../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md), it takes [Half](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md#Halving) damage from that damage type.

If that damage requires it to make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), it has [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on that check.
*To save against poison or disease, for example*
