# Unconscious
 While a creature is unconscious it is [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md), can’t speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
 
- It drops whatever it is holding and falls [Prone](Prone.md).
- It automatically fails [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) and [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
- Attack [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) against it have [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md).
- Any attack [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) that hits it is a [Critical Hit](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Hit.md) provided the attacker is within 5 feet.
