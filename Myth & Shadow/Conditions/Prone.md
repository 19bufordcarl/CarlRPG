# Prone

A prone creature's only [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) option is to crawl.

It has [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on [Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) rolls.

[Attacks](../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) if the attacker is within 5 feet of the prone creature. Otherwise, the [Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) has [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).

If a creature is flying or similar when it becomes prone, they immediately start falling.

A prone creature can stand up with 5' of [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) and end this condition.
