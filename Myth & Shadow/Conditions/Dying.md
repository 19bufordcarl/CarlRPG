# Dying

## Turns Until Death Counter
When a PC starts dying, they roll a d4 and add their [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). This number is the 'turns until death counter'. The PC [Dies](Dying.md#Dead) after that many [Turns](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). This result has a minimum of 1 turn.

Every time a PC gains the [Dying](Dying.md) condition, they also gain 1 [Scar](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md).

*By default, all NPCs have a counter of 0, and thus die immediately upon hitting 0 [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).*
## Death Saves
At the start of each of the PCs subsequent turns, they roll a d20.
- On a natural 20, they regain consciousness with 1 [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
	- Otherwise, they decrease their [Turns Until Death Counter](Dying.md#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) by 1. 
- Each *point* of damage they take while dying decreases their [Turns Until Death Counter](Dying.md#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) by 1.
- The moment a PC's [Turns Until Death Counter](Dying.md#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0, they [Die](Dying.md#Dead).

*Ex. I start dying and I roll a 1 on my d4 and have 0 CON. On my turn I roll a 14. My 'turns until death counter' becomes 0. I die right there. I do not pass go. I do not collect $200.* 

## While Dying
While a PC is dying, the following is true
- The PC is [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
- The PC gains the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
- An ally can [Stabilize](Stabilized.md) the PC as an [Action](../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) with a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
## Healing
- If a PC's [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is restored 1 or more by means other than [Stabilization](Stabilized.md):
	- The PC wakes up and is no longer [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
	- *The PC is still [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) unless otherwise specified*
## Dead
When a PC's [Turns Until Death Counter](Dying.md#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0 it dies.

Dead PCs are retired from play into the hall of fame (or infamy).
