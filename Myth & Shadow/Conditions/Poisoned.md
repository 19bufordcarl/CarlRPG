# Poisoned X

At the start of the poisoned creature's [Turn](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md), it takes X [Necrotic](../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage. 
- *(Every 6 seconds until cured).*

After taking this damage, if the creature's [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are 0, it gains the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.

*This damage continues while a creature is [Dying](Dying.md) unless otherwise specified.*
