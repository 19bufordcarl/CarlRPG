# Poisoned X
At the start of your [Turn](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md), you take X [Necrotic](../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage. (Every 6 seconds until cured).

After taking this damage, if your [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are 0, you gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.

*This damage continues while you are [Dying](Dying.md). If the poison was the result of a failed [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), you may repeat that [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) once you start dying to see if your body fends off the poison.*
