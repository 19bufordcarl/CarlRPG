# Immune

If a creature is immune to a [Damage Type](../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md), they take no damage from that type.

If that damage would cause a creature to make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), it automatically succeeds it and is immune to any other results of that check as well.
- *Ex. immunity to poison damage also makes you immune to the effect of that poison causing you to fall [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).*
