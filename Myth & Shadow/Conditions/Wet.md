# Wet

A creature immersed in water becomes wet.

If a wet creature is either a [Humanoid](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Humanoid.md) or an [Animal](../Resources%20for%20GMs/Creatures/Creature%20Types/Animal.md), they are [Vulnerable](Vulnerable.md) to [Cold](../Damage%20Types/Cold.md) and [Lightning](../Damage%20Types/Lightning.md) damage and resistant to [Fire](../Magic/Spells/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) damage until they dry off.
