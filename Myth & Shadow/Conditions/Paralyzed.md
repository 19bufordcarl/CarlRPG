# Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature is [Incapacitated](Incapacitated.md) and can’t speak.

It automatically fails [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) and [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

[Attacks](../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) against it have [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md).

Any [Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) that hits it is a [Critical Hit](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Hit.md) if the attacker is within 5 feet of it.
