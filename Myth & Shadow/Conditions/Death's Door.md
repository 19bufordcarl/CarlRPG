# Death's Door
When a PC gains a [Scar](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) that puts them over their 5 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) maximum number of allowed [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md), they gain the [Death's Door](Death's%20Door.md) condition (they are at death's door).
- If a scar is healed, putting them under their threshold, they cease being at [Death's Door](Death's%20Door.md).

While on [Death's Door](Death's%20Door.md), any damage dealt to that PCs [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) causes them to [Die](Dying.md) instantly.
## Blaze of Glory
A PC on [Death's Door](Death's%20Door.md) can choose to go out in a blaze of glory. They die at the end of the their [Turn](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md), but automatically [Critically Succeed](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md) everything this [Turn](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md), and can propose any effect to the referee within reason to help their comrades.
