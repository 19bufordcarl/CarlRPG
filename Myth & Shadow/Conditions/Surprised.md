# Surprised

A creature is considered surprised if it was unaware of *all* hostile creatures when it began engaging them in [Combat](../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md). The GM determines surprise before [Initiative](../Game%20Procedures/Initiative.md) is rolled.

A surprised creature's initiative rolls are automatically treated as a natural one.

[Surprised](Surprised.md) is removed from a creature at the end of a [Round](../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) of [Combat](../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md).
