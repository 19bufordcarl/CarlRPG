# Threatened

While you are in range of a combatant capable of making a [Melee Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) against you, you are considered threatened.

While threatened, your [Ranged Attacks](../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) have [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).

*A creature's natural attacks such as claws count as melee weapons*
