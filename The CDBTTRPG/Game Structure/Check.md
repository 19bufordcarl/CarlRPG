# Check

A check is made to resolve an uncertain situation with stakes.

A check is made by rolling a d20 and adding relevant modifiers.

The check is successful if it beats the difficulty class (DC) of the target.

The referee always sets the DC prior to the roll, and a player should be sure the referee has set the DC before the roll to preserve the integrity of the DC.

A result of 20 (natural 20) is always a success no matter what. And in certain cases results in a critical success (meaning there is some benefit you receive).

A result of 1 (natural 1) is always a failure no matter what. And in certain cases results in a critical failure (meaning there is some detriment you receive).

The reason 20 is a success and 1 is a failure is to enforce the notion that the referee should only call for a check when the outcome is *uncertain*, otherwise, just resolve the outcome and move on.
