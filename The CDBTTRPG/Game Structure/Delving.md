# Delving

When in an especially hostile environment, (a dungeon) the party is considered delving.

While delving, time is divided into 10-minute segments called turns. Most major actions (moving, searching, fighting, resting, etc.) take one turn to complete.

## The Dungeon Hazard Die

| d6 | Result |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Encounter: The referee should have something prepared, or a table |
| 2 | Fatigue: Each party member takes 1 damage to their [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) |
| 3 | Burn: Torches burn out |
| 4 | Shift: The dungeon environment changes in some way (or free if none) |
| 5 | Sign: The party finds a sign of their next encounter or something secret nearby |
| 6 | Free: No effect |
## Delve Movement

- **Crawl**: The standard movement rate in a dungeon is 120 feet (24 five-foot squares) per turn. Characters moving at this speed actually spend most of the time standing still and listening, testing surfaces, and drawing maps. This allows the party to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid being surprised. 

- **Walking**: 2,400 feet (480 five-foot squares) per turn. At walking speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters and spring all traps. 

- **Running**: 4,800 feet (960 five-foot squares) per turn. At running speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters, spring all traps, and cannot map their environment. Candles held while running go out.
## Illumination

If the party finds itself in total darkness they cannot use their map to navigate and most actions will be difficult or impossible. 

- **Torches**: Illuminate general shapes within 40 feet, and details within 10 feet. Uses a slot.

- **Candles**: Illuminate general shapes within 20 feet, and details within 5 feet. One candle will generally last for a dungeon crawl. 

- **Lanterns**: As candles, but they cannot be blown out. Uses a slot.
## Searching

**Hidden Features**: PCs can spend a turn searching a room to reveal any non-obvious features (a statuette inside a drawer, a cracked tile, etc.) In dim light like candlelight, this takes two turns. 

**Secret Features**: Secret features like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc. should have corresponding clues but can only be found through the players describing the PCâ€™s actions.
