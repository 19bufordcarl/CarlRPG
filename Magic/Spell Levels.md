# Spell Levels

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. Typically, a [Spell](Spells/Spell%20Index.md) of certain level is accessible according to the rule.

Max Spell Level $= \lceil$Caster Ability Score / $2 \rceil$ 

Said in language, the maximum spell level spell level is equal to the relevant ability score of the caster rounded up. Usually, arcane spells use [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and divine spells use [Wisdom](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md). 

###### Personal Note
This is a somewhat unfortunate naming scheme inherited from historical RPGs. It is more mental effort to change this language than deal with it in my opinion.
