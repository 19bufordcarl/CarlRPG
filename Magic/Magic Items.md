# Magic Items

Mortals cannot use magic on their own. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though artifacts, referred to a spell items.

For campaigns which will involve magic as an option, you can have the PCs discover these artifacts during the first session, or during character creation, similar to a class. And it should be the players choice as the artifact will act similarly to how a class would work.

This idea comes from wanting to enforce the fantasy trope of the magic sword, book, ring, or item that transform the protagonist from normal person to hero. 

As a secondary note, at higher levels it is fine to have characters unlock the secrets and power within themselves, but the artifact is a nice way to make that progression feel more impactful then if the player gets the power to use and understand magic right from the start.
