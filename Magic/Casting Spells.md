# Casting Spells

Some [Magic Items](Magic%20Items.md) can allow the bearer to cast spells. Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md)

In order to cast a [Spell](Spells.md), you must make the appropriate ability [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). Typically, arcane spells require [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), while divine spells require [Wisdom](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md). To successfully cast the spell, you must meet the [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) for that spell. More powerful spells have higher [DCs](../Game%20Structure/DC.md), usually equal to 10 + that [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md). 

If you fail the spell casting, you may choose to succeed it instead, you take [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) damage equal to the difference between the result of your roll and the spell's DC. If this reduces your FP to 0, you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
