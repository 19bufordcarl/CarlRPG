# Casting Spells

Some [Magic Items](Magic%20Items.md) can allow the bearer to cast spells. Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md)

In order to cast a [Spell](Spells.md), you must make the appropriate ability [Check](../Game%20Structure/Check.md). Typically, arcane spells require [Intelligence](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md), while divine spells require [Wisdom](../Player%20Character%20Components/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md). To successfully cast the spell, you must meet the [DC](../Game%20Structure/DC.md) for that spell. More powerful spells have higher [DCs](../Game%20Structure/DC.md), usually equal to 10 + that spell's 'level' as it is called in classic TTRPGs. 

Say failing a spell cast causes [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Character%20Components/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) damage.
