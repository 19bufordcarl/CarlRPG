# Spell Items

Mortals cannot use magic on their own. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though artifacts.

A good rule is to have the PCs discover these artifacts during the first session. And it should be the players choice as the artifact will act similarly to how a class would work.
