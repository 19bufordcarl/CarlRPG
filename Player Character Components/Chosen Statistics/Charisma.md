# Charisma

Abbreviated as **CHA**

Your charisma represents the strength of your connection to your fellow human and yourself.
The guaranteed use cases for charisma (you may add your stat to the roll) are as follows:

- Social skills (persuade, deceive, intimidate, perform, impress, etc.)
- Morale skills (loyalty of followers)
- Determines how many NPCs followers you can have
- Using divine magic for certain patrons

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **CHA**
