Your ancestry does not confer any real mechanical benefits in this game by default.

If your setting does have fantasy ancestries, then the appropriate benefits would be the following

- That ancestry's lifespan, physical appearance, language, social context and culture.

You can add additional mechanics but that is not assumed. I don't like having abilities tied to your ancestry personally. I want my character's appearance to be independent of their mechanics.

For reference, my default list of ancestries is usually along these lines

- Human
- Elf
- Dwarf
- Orc
- Halfling
- Lizardfolk
- Catfolk
- Devilkin
