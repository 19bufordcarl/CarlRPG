# Health Points

Health Points (HP) represent your health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you fall unconscious and die in d4 + 1 [Round](../../Game%20Structure/Round.md)s at the start of your [Turn](../../Game%20Structure/Turn.md) that round.

When you take damage, you reduce your [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) before you reduce your HP. When you are out of FP you start talking HP damage, and that is bad news. 

HP regenerates slowly, after a full day of rest you can regenerate 1 HP. If you ever take 5 or more damage to your HP, you incur a [Scars](Scars.md), which reduces your constitution by 1 permanently.

###### By default, your HP is equal to 10 + your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)
