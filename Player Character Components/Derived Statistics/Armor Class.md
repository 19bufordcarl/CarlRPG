A player's armor class is kept as this name for the historical purpose of AC being recognizable as the number you roll on the d20 to "hit". A d20 roll need to meet or beat the armor class you have to connect and deal damage.

In actuality we use this more as "evasion class". [Armor](Armor.md) is an item, and it does not help you evade hits, it reduces damage. Regardless, AC is recognizable and easy to understand at a glance.

A player's AC is equal to their [Dexterity](Dexterity.md), but cannot go below 0. As a reminder, a natural 1 is always a miss.
