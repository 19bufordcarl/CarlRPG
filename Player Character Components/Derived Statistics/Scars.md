Scars are gained whenever a PC loses 5 or more [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) from a single hit. By default, a scar reduces that PCs constitution by 1 permanently, and that player should change the description of the PC slightly to reflect this scar.

Scars do not heal naturally, and even minor magic cannot heal a scar. Healing a scar usually comes from relatively powerful magic, usually accessible for PCs around level 5.
