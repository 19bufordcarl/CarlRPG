This game uses an Item Slot system. An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. A PC has 10 + [[Constitution]] item slots. 

An item slot is something that either 
	1. Weighs between 5-10 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

**EXCEPTION**: One day worth of rations take up 1/2 an item slot

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are
	1. 20 arrows in a quiver
	2. 20 candles
	3. 20 pieces of chalk
	4. 20 sling stones
	5. 1000 coins

The PC's clothing (not armor) and pack themselves do not take up a slot.

If a PC wishes to carry more than their constitution allows, then they choose to drag their pack. Dragging a pack requires both of their hands. And you can get 2 additional item slots by doing so. If you are attacked while dragging your pack you will skip your first turn in combat as you have to spend it pulling out your weapons and dropping what you were carrying.
