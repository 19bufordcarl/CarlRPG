Fatigue Points (FP) represent your pool of combat experience, endurance, luck, and skill. When you take damage, you reduce your FP before you reduce your [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) (HP). When you are out of FP you start talking HP damage, and that is bad news. 

FP regenerates quickly, after a rest of at least 1 hour you can regenerate all your FP.

###### By default, your FP is equal to 10 + your [Constitution](Constitution.md)
