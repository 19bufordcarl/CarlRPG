# Armor

These are well known armor sets. A PC might end up using a special armor for their character. These are a starting point for a character, and provide context for the baseline in this world. 

While there are no hard cutoffs of light / medium / heavy armor, armor slots provide a smooth scale for how heavy armor is.

Armor reduces the amount of damage taken from physical sources, usually by a fixed amount.

"Stealthy" denotes whether an armor can be used to stealth. If not, you have disadvantage on stealth while wearing the armor. The more item slots, the longer don / doffing takes (max 10 min)
