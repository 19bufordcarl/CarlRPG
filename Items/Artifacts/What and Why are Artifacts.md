# What and Why are Artifacts

This is inspired from Knave, which is a classless game. I enjoy classless games because the abstraction of bundling up a bunch of abilities into class levels and that being how you gain most of your power makes me feel like I am in a box. 

It also hurts my verisimilitude when multiclassing gets involved, but that's how mechanically interesting builds can happen.

And so I had an idea when watching [this Aestus_RPG video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBAptVH4Hl4). Many fantasy characters get there power from a signature item (see bilbo and his ring). 

We can attach the typical class abilities to an artifact that the players find. As the level up they unlock more abilities of this artifact throughout the campaign. This fits in well with knave's focus on items as how you define your character, while still having something similar to class abilities and progression.

It also makes creating your own "class" more natural as you can design a special item that will enable that class fantasy. Feel free to design your own, or base an item around an existing class in another RPG system. As long as it is tied to the artifact and all players are on the same page, the world will "balance" as stronger artifacts will draw stronger foes. That being said, keeping artifacts to a reasonable level is best.
